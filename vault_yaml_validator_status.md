summary: Real-time tracking log for YAML validation across the Anacostia Vault. Monitors audit progress, patch coverage, broken field reports, and compliance rituals.
longform_summary: This scroll captures the status of vault-wide YAML audits. It reflects the patchwork of compliance operations led by VS‑ENC, CG‑SCRIBE, and OD‑COMPLY across all vault clusters. Includes live status indicators for frontmatter accuracy, field completeness, and tag normalization.
