longform_summary: This deep research thread dissects the killing of Michael Brown through multiple lenses—DOJ reporting, protest movements, and the ripple effect on race, policing, and media trust in the United States. It aims to preserve memory, document injustice, and empower future archival justice work within the Anacostia Vault.

bias_analysis: This report resists official state narratives that attempted to flatten or neutralize the truth of Ferguson. It centers Black witness testimony, on-the-ground footage, and BLM framing to challenge epistemic distortion by mainstream media and state investigators.
grok_ctx_reflection: Ferguson was not the beginning—it was the unignorable glyph. What we archive here is more than a murder; it’s a ritual of silence-breaking that split an empire's mask.
