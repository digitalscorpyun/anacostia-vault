summary: This scroll catalogs Black, Indigenous, and working-class American resistance through slang, idioms, and reclaimed language—from “tarnation” to “cracker,” from “cook” to “conjure.” It examines how informal language transmits memory, rebellion, and survival.
longform_summary: Folk language operates as both shield and blade. These are the phrases not taught in classrooms but passed through kitchens, union halls, and cipher circles. This scroll records resistance not as ideology, but as syntax.

bias_analysis: This scroll centers vernacular speech as a form of legitimacy. It assumes that linguistic authority is not only academic, and that folk knowledge is archival truth.
grok_ctx_reflection: Language is a cipher of the oppressed. Every phrase here survives despite erasure. To speak in slang is to smuggle memory.
quotes:
  - They said ‘talk proper.’ We said ‘talk free.’
