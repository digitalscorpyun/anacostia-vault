  Burkina is not just a battlefield — it's a barometer. This scroll traces how Sankara's fire still burns beneath red berets and gold mines, across villages, WhatsApp chains, and the ruins of Loropéni.

# 🗺️ **Burkina Faso: Revolutionary Past and Contemporary Challenges**

## 🔥 Revolutionary History

In 1983, Captain **Thomas Sankara** seized power through a popular uprising and ignited the *Révolution démocratique et populaire* (RDP). He renamed the country *Burkina Faso* — "Land of Upright People" — and launched one of Africa’s most radical experiments in anti-imperial governance.

Sankara:
- Launched land reform, reforestation, and food self-sufficiency drives
- Advanced universal education and healthcare (dropping infant mortality rates drastically)
- Criminalized forced marriage and female genital mutilation
- Created revolutionary tribunals to prosecute corruption

His rhetoric was uncompromising:
> _“Let’s decolonize our minds.”_  
He called foreign aid a trap and imperialism “a system to be liquidated.”

On **15 October 1987**, Sankara was assassinated in a coup led by **Blaise Compaoré**, his former comrade. Only in **2022** were Compaoré and others convicted (in absentia) for the murder.

Yet Sankara’s ghost remains a moral force — invoked by a new generation of Burkinabè leaders.

## 🛡️ Current Leadership & Politics

In **2022**, **Captain Ibrahim Traoré**, just 34, ousted the ruling junta and declared a return to revolutionary nationalism. Traoré:
- Dresses in red fatigues and references Sankara’s speeches
- Expelled French military advisors
- Promoted ties with **Russia** and **China**
- Co-founded the **Alliance of Sahel States (AES)** with **Mali** and **Niger**

By **mid-2024**, the AES formally broke from **ECOWAS**, declaring:
> _“We reject all foreign interference. The Sahel governs itself.”_

---

## 💰 Economic Frontlines

Burkina Faso remains poor — but rich in cotton and gold.

- Cotton: 50–60% of exports
- Gold: Booming, central to GDP

Traoré’s regime:
- Created a state mining company
- Mandated 15% Burkinabè ownership of all foreign mines
- Began planning a **national gold refinery**

Despite resource nationalism, the nation still carries **$5.6B** in external debt and relies heavily on **IMF/World Bank** loans. Much infrastructure is now funded by **China’s Belt & Road** and supported by **Russia** with military guarantees.

## ⚔️ Security & Insurgency

Since **2015**, Burkina has battled jihadist insurgents from **Al-Qaeda (JNIM)** and **Islamic State (ISGS)**.

- Over **2.6 million** internally displaced
- 100+ civilians massacred in early 2024 attacks
- Dozens of VDP (Volontaires pour la Défense de la Patrie) militias mobilized

AES (Burkina, Mali, Niger) launched a joint **5,000-strong counterinsurgency force** in early 2025, with air and intelligence support — **trained by Russia**.

Yet **Wagner Group rumors** swirl, and abuses by militias fuel ethnic tensions. The fight for security remains unstable and bloody.

---

## 🧬 Culture & Society

- **Mossi** traditions dominate, but Burkina is a rich mosaic: **Fula**, **Dyula**, **Gurma**, and **Lobi** (e.g. Ruins of Loropéni — UNESCO site).
- Only ~15% speak French daily; **Mooré** remains the dominant language
- Urban youth use **slam poetry, rap, and protest music** to echo Sankara’s spirit

> _“Balai Citoyen” (2014) and “Résistance” youth groups (2022) emerged as cultural insurgencies._

---

## 🛰️ Media & Perception Warfare

Burkina’s junta:
- Banned **TV5Monde**, suspended outlets, and harassed reporters
- Passed a 2023 media law that lets the president appoint regulators and shut down dissent
- Monitors social media users with >5,000 followers

Meanwhile, state media glorifies Traoré via **AI-generated pop songs**, **Telegram memes**, and stylized **revolutionary propaganda**.

Western press highlights instability. Pan-African outlets frame it as self-determination.
