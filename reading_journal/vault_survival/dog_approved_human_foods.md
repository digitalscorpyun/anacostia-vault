bias_analysis: |
  This scroll assumes a Western kitchen baseline (common foods like peanut butter, chocolate, avocado) and may not reflect non-Western culinary contexts where alternative dangers or traditions apply. Expansion is needed for diasporic food environments.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Consider this a companion glyph to broader sacred-tech rituals of care. Companion animals occupy both physical and spiritual domains — and food is the bridge. This note embodies the ethics of guardianship in a posthuman age, where data meets devotion.
quotes:
  - If it needs seasoning, it’s not for the beast. If it was hunted on YouTube, it ain’t wild enough for his bowl.
