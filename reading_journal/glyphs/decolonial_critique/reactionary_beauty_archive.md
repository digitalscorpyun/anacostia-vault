bias_analysis: Archive does not present aesthetic content as neutral. All images carry ideology. This glyph prioritizes analysis of visual rhetoric used to reinforce systemic control and identity myths.
grok_ctx_reflection: What we call “beauty” under reactionary systems is often not beauty at all—it’s fear, nostalgia, and control, wrapped in symmetry. The archive reveals how fascism wears filters.
quotes:
  - The prettier the picture, the uglier the politics.
  - Trad is not tradition—it’s performance of hierarchy.
  - The alt-right doesn’t march in uniform—they post in high resolution.
