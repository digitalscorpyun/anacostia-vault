bias_analysis: This node recognizes that economic narratives are often laundered through whiteness to produce racialized policy and reactionary culture.
grok_ctx_reflection: Paranoia isn't irrational when it’s incentivized—white grievance has been codified, monetized, and rebranded as “legitimate fear” within systems designed to deflect class war into culture war.

## 💰 Capital and Crisis

Economic paranoia among white Americans isn’t just fear—it’s *ritualized deflection*. Stephanie Li frames this as the emotional substrate of whiteness under late capitalism, where the erosion of economic dominance births racialized scapegoating.

- Lost jobs = “They’re taking *our* jobs”  
- Globalization = “America’s greatness is being stolen”  
- Automation = “Elites are betraying the common man”  

Each is an economic wound weaponized into identity politics.

## 🔄 Feedback Loop of Fear

1. Structural change (outsourcing, tech shifts)  
2. Personal insecurity (job loss, wage stagnation)  
3. Cultural translation: blame racial Others  
4. Political radicalization and algorithmic affirmation  

This process mirrors **reactionary AI behavior**—repeating the input data of fear, racism, and grievance until it becomes the *only logic that makes sense*.

## 🛠️ Work to Be Done

- Compare with `white_backlash_timeline.md`  
- Add case study blocks (Rust Belt, Brexit, 2024 GOP rhetoric)  
- Extract economic metaphors used in white nationalist literature
