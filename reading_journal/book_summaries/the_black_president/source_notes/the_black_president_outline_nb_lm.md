# 🧠 **The Black President Outline – NotebookLM Extraction**

## 🔮 Core Focus
Barack Obama’s presidency as interpreted through racial context, public figures, and historical framing. Organized around a timeline (1950s–2017) and "cast of characters."

## 📆 Timeline Highlights
Spanning Obama Sr.’s ideological affiliations to Obama Jr.’s exit from the presidency, this includes:
- **African independence movements** (1960)
- **Obama’s rise** from Illinois Senate (1997) → US Senate (2004) → Presidency (2008)
- **Major policy acts**, crises (Great Recession), and pivotal racial moments (Michael Brown, Ferguson)
- **Cultural diplomacy** via music, symbolism, and Black artistry
- **Trump's counter-narrative** arc culminating in 2016

## 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏾 Cast of Characters
Family, mentors, critics, collaborators:
- **Obama Family Lineage** – Barack Sr., Michelle, Ann Dunham, Auma
- **Black Political Figures** – Artur Davis, Bobby Rush, Cornel West, Jesse Jackson Jr.
- **Advisors & Strategists** – Valerie Jarrett, David Axelrod, Stephanie Cutter
- **Cultural Voices** – Jay-Z, Common, Ludacris, Nicki Minaj, Ice-T
- **Critics & Supporters** – Robert Johnson, Andrew Young, Cornel West, Al Sharpton
- **Opponents** – Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Darren Wilson

## 📚 Thematic Nodes
