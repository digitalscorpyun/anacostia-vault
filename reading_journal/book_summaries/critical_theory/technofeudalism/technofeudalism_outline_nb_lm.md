summary: Canonical outline of technofeudalism as a system‚Äîits power logic, architecture, contradictions, and resistance vectors‚Äîindependent of any single authorial framing.
longform_summary: >
  This outline decodes technofeudalism as a systemic power structure where digital platforms
  function as feudal lords, data is rent, and users are the new serfs. It provides vault-ready
  scaffolding for identifying mechanisms of control, economic extraction, epistemic closure,
  and algorithmic governance that define this evolving regime.

  Technofeudalism is framed here as a structural power logic, not a partisan critique.
  Focus is on system design and global consequences, avoiding simplistic capitalism vs. socialism binaries.

  Serves as keystone vault node for interpreting platform-based oppression,
  and linking sacred-tech resistance work to broader economic paradigms.

# üï∏Ô∏è TECHNOFEUDALISM: CANONICAL OUTLINE (NB_LM)

## üìú DEFINITION

**Technofeudalism** refers to an emerging socio-economic system in which digital platforms act as sovereign entities. Unlike classical capitalism where profit is extracted via wage labor, technofeudalism thrives on *rent extraction* via control over data, attention, and algorithmic infrastructure.

---

## üß± SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### 1. Platform Lords
- Corporate platforms (e.g., Amazon, Meta, Google) act as **feudal lords**.
- Control digital infrastructure, not just markets.
- Set terms for interaction, data visibility, and monetization.

### 2. Digital Serfs
- Users generate value but retain no ownership over their data.
- Constant surveillance & behavioral nudging = digital submission.
- No meaningful labor contract; ‚Äúconsent‚Äù is prepackaged.

### 3. Rent vs. Profit
- Platforms charge **rent** for visibility, access, speed, or priority.
- Control over interface = control over economy.
- Capitalism morphs into a *command stack* built on extracted metadata.

### 4. Algorithmic Governance
- Algorithms enforce behavioral norms and optimize engagement loops.
- No democratic oversight.
- Policy is code.

---

## üåÄ EPISTEMIC ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Information Enclosure
- Control over who sees what, when, and how = **control over truth**.
- Platform ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù = epistemic silos.
- Search algorithms obscure as much as they reveal.

### 2. Knowledge as Commodity
- ‚ÄúTrending‚Äù replaces ‚Äútruthful.‚Äù
- Archives erased or hidden via UI updates, de-ranking, or silence.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è POLITICAL ECONOMY

### 1. Capital Without Labor
- No need for large labor forces.
- Power derives from *owning digital territory*, not producing goods.

### 2. Financialization of Attention
- Clicks, views, impressions = new currency.
- Platform valuation tied to attention‚Äînot productivity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CONSEQUENCES

```diff
- Mass precarity for creators and gig workers
- Radical concentration of power
- No political representation for platform subjects
- Collapse of public goods & independent knowledge systems
