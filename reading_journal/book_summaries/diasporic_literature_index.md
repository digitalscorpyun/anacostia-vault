summary: A curated vault index of critical diasporic texts aligned with resistance theory, decolonial frameworks, and memory reclamation.
longform_summary: This index organizes key works of diasporic literature through thematic resistance vectors and Adinkra-coded significance. Each text is not merely archived, but activated as part of the Anacostia Vault’s cultural counter-insurgency and epistemic recovery.
