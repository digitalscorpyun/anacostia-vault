# 📖 *A Map to the Door of No Return* — Dionne Brand

## 🧠 UBW Summary

**Origins:**  
The Middle Passage becomes not just a historical rupture, but a mythic, personal one — the door that severs memory from land, language from origin.

**Mods:**  
Brand blurs genres—memoir, philosophy, poetry. Her “map” refuses borders, inviting recursive readings of belonging, diaspora, and femininity.

**Current State:**  
The door of no return haunts not as trauma alone but as a cartographic method — a Black poetics of unanchored knowing.

## 🔍 Notes To Belonging – Reflection Glyphs

- Belonging is neither nation nor passport — it’s memory unsilenced.
- To map is to mark loss. To name is to resist erasure.
- Canada is not home. It’s an archive of estrangement.
- Caribbean childhood recurs as mnemonic loop, not narrative arc.
