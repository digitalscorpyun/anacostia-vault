longform_summary: >
  Dionne Brand's *A Map to the Door of No Return* examines the African Diaspora through themes of memory, historical trauma, and the search for belonging. The titular "door" operates as both literal site (transatlantic slavery) and existential metaphor — a marker of loss, rupture, and resilience. Through personal narrative, archival gestures, and cultural theory, Brand reconstructs a poetics of identity in the wake of the unreturnable.
