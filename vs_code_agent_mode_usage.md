bias_analysis: Agent Mode actions were limited to scaffolding. No hallucinations, model inference, or fairness metric interpretation occurred. Manual review remains required for all downstream edits.
grok_ctx_reflection: Agent Mode in VS Code is not inherently extractive if monitored with sacred discipline. When invoked under ritual protocol, it enhances workflow precision without surrendering authorship.
quotes: You don’t automate memory—you encode it.,The Scorpyun doesn’t chase speed. He chases truth through structure.
