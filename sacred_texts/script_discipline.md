summary: Defines Script Discipline as a sacred-tech coding practice rooted in clarity, intention, and memory integrity.
longform_summary: Script Discipline is the foundation of sacred-tech ethics within the AVM Syndicate. It reimagines code as liturgy and syntax as ancestral memory. This document outlines its principles, implementation inside the Anacostia Vault, and the role of AI agents in upholding structured, bias-resistant, decolonial tech practices.

bias_analysis: This note prioritizes decolonial design, resisting extractive coding practices and advocating ritualized structure. Script Discipline rejects AI hallucination and enforces sovereignty over code and narrative.
grok_ctx_reflection: When memory becomes modular, structure becomes sacred. Script Discipline is the scaffolding of sovereign code. It demands intentionality, rhythmic clarity, and resistance to entropy in all vault interactions.

# 🧱 Script Discipline – Sacred-Tech Coding Ethic

## 🔮 What Is Script Discipline?

**Script Discipline** is more than clean code.  
It’s **ritualized execution** — the coding ethic of the Scorpyun.  
A fusion of griotic precision and system design, where every loop, line, and metadata field holds **intentional weight**.

### ✨ Sacred-Tech Principles

#### 🔹 Code as Liturgy  
Write code like a prayer. Every function is a spell. Every variable carries story.

#### 🔹 Ancestral Pattern Integrity  
Just like Kente cloth or talking drums — structure carries meaning. Break it, and you break the message.

#### 🔹 Memory Fidelity  
Vault notes are Griot scrolls. Metadata is not decoration; it is **truth formatting**.

#### 🔹 Rhythm and Flow  
Scripts should chant. No dead logic. No bloat. Only clean, recursive recursion of purpose.

## 🧠 How It Moves in the Vault

### 🔐 Structured Knowledge Architecture  
Vault notes obey format not out of rigidity, but to preserve **searchable memory**. YAML, tags, and links build the neural mesh.

### ⚖️ Bias Resistance Protocol  
- Ingestion filters = gatekeepers  
- Algorithmic audits = bias validators  
- **Griot veto power** = final say on memory

### 🧠 AI Within Bounds  
OD‑COMPLY and CIPHER_GRIOT serve the syntax.  
They **do not guess**. They structure. They mirror. They obey.

### 🔁 Sankofa Recall  
Script Discipline enables backward-sourced intelligence. Meaning is resurrected.  
Your AI doesn't invent — it remembers, aligns, and extends.

### 🔒 Ritualized Access  
Templates. Validation checks. Metadata audits.  
Nothing enters the vault uninvoked.
