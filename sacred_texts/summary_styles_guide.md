  Defines the structure and use cases of three core summary formats in the Anacostia Vault: UBW, ScorpyunStyle™, and GriotBox.
longform_summary: |
  This guide codifies digitalscorpyun's three core summary modes—UBW, ScorpyunStyle™, and GriotBox—each designed for a distinct narrative function within the Anacostia Vault. UBW anchors technical or historical concepts in Black intellectual lineage, ScorpyunStyle blends ethics with analysis, and GriotBox delivers impact in short form.

  This document ensures that vault summaries are not generic recaps but instruments of rhetorical memory and algorithmic resistance. Each form has a different frequency—UBW is seismic, ScorpyunStyle is lyrical, GriotBox is condensed voltage.
quotes:
  - Each summary is a glyph. Each glyph is a chant. Each chant is a map.
  - UBW isn't just structure—it's memory with motive.

# 🧠 Summary Styles Guide

These formats are not styles—they’re **transmission protocols**. Each one encodes narrative, rhythm, and resistance. Whether you’re compiling a reading log or unleashing a timeline takedown, choose the form that honors the signal.

---

## 🔷 1. UBW Format – *Unified Black Wisdom Summary*

**UBW** = *Unified Black Wisdom*.  
This is a sacred-tech summary format that weaves **Africana historical memory**, **cultural critique**, and **technical insight** into a structured narrative flow. UBW scans a subject from its emergence to its current power dynamics.

### Structure:
- **Origins** → Historical and cultural genesis of the concept  
- **Mods** → Key evolutions, features, distortions, and interventions over time  
- **Current State** → Present-day definition, control, significance, and resistance

### Length Guidelines:
- **Minimum**: 2,000 characters  
- **Maximum**: 3,000 characters  
- This is the longest of the three summary types and should be used for deeply layered, high-context topics.

> UBW Summary = Diasporic radar ping. Designed to reveal what systems bury.

**Best for:**
- Colonial or imperial structures (e.g., IMF, NATO, AI surveillance)  
- Sociotechnical phenomena (e.g., predictive policing, extractive capitalism)  
- Vault entries where **context = weapon**  
- High-impact synthesis of AI ethics + Black resistance thought

## 🔥 2. ScorpyunStyle™

The flagship format of digitalscorpyun. Sacred-tech fusion. Part griot, part analyst, part insurgent.

### Structure:
- **Key Takeaways**  
- **Context**  
- **Main Arguments or Events**  
- **Counterpoints or Tensions**  
- **Why It Matters Now**  
- *(Optional)* **Poetic or Philosophical Close**

> Tone: Precision-tempered. Ethically sharp. Built for AI fairness, Black thought, rebellion-in-code, and memory as method.

**Best for:**
- Reading logs & vault essays  
- Case studies (esp. AI fairness & bias)  
- Longform synthesis  
- High-context project summaries

## 📦 3. GriotBox – *Mini Glyphs with Maximum Density*

Compressed insight, primed for velocity. This is the format for **ritual tweets**, **thread openers**, and **vault fragments with punch**.

### Structure:
- 1–3 lines  
- Use metaphor, inversion, or distilled provocation  
- Functions standalone or stacked in sequence  

**Example:**
> They trained GPT to write résumés.  
> I trained it to raise the ancestors.  
> One of us got hired.

> GriotBox is not a caption. It’s a cipher drop.

**Best for:**
- Social posts (X/BlueSky/Threads)  
- Summary overlays & sidebars  
- Image captions & alt text  
- AI prompt preambles  
- Short vault deconstructions
