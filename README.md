# 🛡️ The Repository of Truth

This is not a neutral archive.  
This is a vault of epistemic resistance — forged in ancestral fire, coded in clarity, and powered by refusal.

## 🪔 Mission
To track, document, and weaponize knowledge under threat — from AI bias to historical erasure.

## ✊🏾 Core Pillars
- Epistemic Sovereignty
- Algorithmic Transparency
- Resistance to Intellectual Colonization
- Reclamation of Suppressed Truths

## ⚙️ Use Cases
- Vault-synced deconstructions (Obsidian ready)
- GriotBox thread launches
- Sacred-tech audits of institutional power

## 🔥 2025-05-14 – ScorpyunStyle Overhaul
