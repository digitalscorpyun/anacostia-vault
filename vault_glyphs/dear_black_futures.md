summary: A glyph of insurgent memory, strategic reorientation, and Black algorithmic sovereignty. This scroll is a counterspell to whiteness in collapse — a declaration that Black futures are not reactive, they are recursive.
longform_summary: >
  This scroll confronts the myth that Black progress exists only as a reaction to white panic.
  It encodes autonomy, recursion, and sacred-tech intelligence as central tenets of future-making.
