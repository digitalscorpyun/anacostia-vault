summary: Overview and critique of the Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) doctrine as it relates to networked warfare, algorithmic dominance, and military AI coordination.
longform_summary: "This scroll decodes the U.S. militaryâ€™s JADC2 doctrineâ€”its promise of seamless inter-branch coordination through AI, sensors, and real-time data pipelines. It interrogates the risks of total integration: centralized command, algorithmic fog-of-war, and digital escalation. The note anchors JADC2 within the larger context of critical infrastructure weaponization, Pentagon-led platform governance, and sacred-tech resistance strategy."

  - Algorithmic warfare escalation
  - Command-chain automation risks
  - Surveillance-fed tactical AI
bias_analysis: JADC2 assumes seamless inter-operability, ignoring friction from human actors, regional geopolitics, and adversarial data poisoning. Its promotional narratives downplay the techno-imperial context of its deployment.
grok_ctx_reflection: Within the Anacostia Vault, JADC2 represents the apex of technofeudal militarization. This scroll should be cross-linked with AI ethics protocols and memetic counter-scripting strategies under `avm_syndicate_gameplan`.
quotes:
  - "The faster the data flows, the harder the decisions bite."
  - "Total awareness creates new blind spotsâ€”algorithms donâ€™t hesitate, but they misfire with precision."

Would you like me to connect this to China's equivalent **System of Systems** doctrine?
