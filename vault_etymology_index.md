summary: An index of etymological fragments and phrase origins tracked across the Anacostia Vault, including euphemisms, idioms, and power-coded language used historically or strategically.
longform_summary: >
  This lexicon anchors the hidden meanings embedded in everyday terms—
  especially those weaponized, whitened, or worn down by empire. These
  etymologies are memory reclamation points: language that once stung,
  summoned, or resisted.
