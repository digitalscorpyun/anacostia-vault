## 🗣️ Message Sent

> Hi, this is Michael Kibbe — a nearby neighbor and someone who’s helped out before with box breakdown at your shop.
> 
> I wanted to kindly bring something to your attention. Around 5:30 AM this morning, I was woken by the sound of forklift activity and truck loading coming from your lot. I fully understand the importance of early operations, but this morning’s noise was unusually loud and started quite early.
> 
> To my knowledge, San Bernardino has regulations regarding industrial noise during certain hours, especially near residential areas. I’m reaching out respectfully to ask if early operations could begin a bit later — ideally after 7:00 AM — to help minimize disruption for nearby residents.
> 
> I appreciate the work you all do and simply wanted to open a thoughtful dialogue. Thank you for your time and consideration.
> 
> **Warm regards,**
