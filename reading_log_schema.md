# 📊 `reading_log_schema.md`

## 🎯 Purpose

This schema standardizes how AI-generated summaries are stored and processed throughout the Anacostia Vault.  
It serves as the bridge between:
- 🔹 `reading_log.csv` (flat logs)
- 🔹 `.md` note generation (via `extract_and_summarize.py`)
- 🔹 multi-agent handoffs in the AVM Syndicate

All entries are formatted as structured JSON objects and support both human and machine-readable workflows.

## 🗂️ Integration & Usage

- 📄 **`reading_log.csv`**  
   → Used as a centralized index of processed works. Parsed by AVM micro-agents for reflection prompts, recommendations, or thematic stats.

- 🧾 **Obsidian `.md` Generation**  
   → JSON values feed into prestructured notes with YAML frontmatter + ScorpyunStyle™ layout.

- 🤖 **AVM Agent Workflows**  
   → Agents like `OD‑COMPLY` and `CIPHER_GRIOT` extract, refine, and tag based on this structure.

- 🔍 **Dataview Queries**  
   → Enables filtered views by tag, agent, timeframe, or theme inside the Vault UI.
