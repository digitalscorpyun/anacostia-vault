summary: Clean split between fascism (state form of ultranationalist "rebirth") and white supremacy (caste logic organizing law, life, and loot around "whiteness"); map the overlap and the danger.
longform_summary: |
  Fascism centralizes power through leader cults, paramilitary mobilization, and a palingenetic myth
  of national renewal that licenses repression. White supremacy naturalizes a racial hierarchy that can
  inhabit many regimes—from liberal democracies to dictatorships—via policy, policing, and culture.
  When the two braid, cruelty scales from custom to code to camp.

bias_analysis: |
  Center Black radical scholarship; avoid both-sides flattening. Note: fascism is not inherently "white,"
  while U.S. practice often ties fascistic method to a white-caste substrate.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Use as a diagnostic during U.S. governance analysis; pair with a Dataview that tracks State Spine,
  Law-to-Muscle, Elections, and Culture signals.
quotes:
  - When the state wants rebirth and whiteness wants rule, policy turns punitive.
  - Receipts before rhetoric; structure protects memory.

## Ultra-Short
Fascism = **state form** of ultranationalist rule.  
White supremacy = **caste logic** of racial domination.  
Together? Policy becomes pogrom.

## SankofaCut (Thesis-First Micro-Brief)
**Thesis:** Fascism organizes the **nation** for “rebirth”; white supremacy arranges **life and law** around “whiteness.”  
- Fascism: leader cult, paramilitary street power, corporatist economy, purge of pluralism.  
- White supremacy: structural advantage for “whites,” diffuse or statutory, from lynch law to zoning maps.  
**Tension:** Rebirth myth (nation) // Naturalized rule (race)  
**So-What:** When they fuse, the state racializes sovereignty—extraction, enclosure, extermination.

## Field Gloss (Receipts in the Margins)
- **Palingenesis (rebirth script):** A decayed nation must be purified and reborn—license for repression (see Griffin; framed here through Black radical lenses).  
- **Caste mechanics:** “Whiteness” as property and policing of the color line (Du Bois; Davis; Wynter’s critique of the overrepresented “Man”).  
- **Racial capitalism:** Market order fused to racial hierarchy (Cedric J. Robinson).

## Side-by-Side
| Dimension | Fascist (state form) | White Supremacist (caste logic) |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of belonging | Nation (mythic, “organic”) | Race (constructed hierarchy) |
| Core promise | National **rebirth** after “decay” | Perpetual **dominance** of “whites” |
| Power style | One-party/hollowed elections, paramilitaries, censorship | Flexible: democracy → dictatorship; law + vigilantes |
| Economy | Corporatist; crush labor; mobilize for war | Any mode: slavery → Jim Crow → redlining → carceral state |
| Violence | Centralized, spectacular, programmatic | Centralized **and/or** decentralized; “policy violence” |
| Scope | Not race-specific (Italy, Japan, Spain, etc.) | Wherever “whiteness” is sovereign (Europe, settler colonies) |

## Overlap & Split
- **Both (canonical):** Nazi Germany—fascist state form + white supremacist (and antisemitic) caste logic → genocide.  
- **Fascist w/o “whiteness”:** Imperial Japan’s ultranationalism; early Fascist Italy pre-radical racialization.  
- **White supremacist w/o full fascist form:** U.S. Jim Crow; South African apartheid (authoritarian caste state, not classic palingenetic mass party).

## Diagnostic Checklist (In the Wild)
- **Leader cult + “rebirth” talk + paramilitaries + purge of pluralism** ⇒ flag **fascism**.  
- **Durable material/legal advantages for “whites” + subordination of others** (whatever the ballot boxes say) ⇒ flag **white supremacy**.  
- **If both fire at once** ⇒ expect industrialized cruelty and expansionary war at home/abroad.

## Receipts (Touchstones to Center)
- **W.E.B. Du Bois**, *Black Reconstruction in America* (1935): democracy, the color line, and how “whiteness” is politically manufactured to discipline labor.  
- **Cedric J. Robinson**, *Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition* (1983): racial capitalism; Europe’s internal hierarchies exported globally.  
- **Sylvia Wynter**, “Unsettling the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom” (2003): the overrepresentation of “Man” and the colonial invention of the human.  
- **Angela Y. Davis**, *Women, Race, & Class* (1981); *Freedom Is a Constant Struggle* (2016): carcerality, gendered race power, and internationalism.  
- (Context note) **Roger Griffin**, *The Nature of Fascism* (1991): “palingenetic ultranationalism” as minimal definition—useful for the **rebirth** diagnostic, but always refracted through Black studies frames above.

## GriotBox — One-Line Sting
**When the state wants rebirth and whiteness wants rule, the drumbeat turns policy into a procession of ghosts.**
