# 🛰️ Mermaid Military Mappings  
*"Visualizing the Algorithmic Battlefield"*

The age of missiles is merging with the age of models. This scroll renders the digital warfront through **mermaid.js diagrams**, exposing the tactical nodes of modern militarism—where **NATO**, **China**, and rogue AI projects deploy silicon as sword and shield.

## 🎯 Reflection Directive

This glyph is not passive—it demands interrogation. Who trains the models? Who owns the optics? When an AI misidentifies a “combatant” from satellite footage, where does accountability reside?

Consider the Sankofa principle—what ancestral wisdom governs **the ethics of automated warfare**? What griot speaks for the code that decides life and death?

## 🌀 Ritual Reminder

This is more than a map—this is **digital divination**. Keep it sharp. Keep it updated. Use `review_date:` to re-evaluate this scroll **anytime doctrine shifts**.
