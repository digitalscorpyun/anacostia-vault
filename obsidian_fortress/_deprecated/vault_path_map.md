summary: Canonicalized vault path map showing all approved note locations and structural clusters within the Anacostia Vault.
longform_summary: This map outlines all primary folders, subpaths, and known semantic clusters that define the ontology of the Anacostia Vault. It supports consistent vault structure, YAML compliance, and programmatic access by automation scripts.

üõ∞Ô∏è Absolutely, digitalscorpyun. Here's a full list of all **proposed or currently active paths** for the Anacostia Vault based on our session work, vault structure, and documented script behavior. These are drawn from YAML frontmatter fields, actual vault use, and projected logical structure.
