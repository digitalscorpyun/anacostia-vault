summary: 
Live operational sigil of digitalscorpyun’s sacred-tech stance: Python sanctification, Flask bridgework, YAML discipline, and labor-pattern witnessing—kept lean, kept true.
longform_summary: 
This scroll is the pulse-reader. With GPT-5 memory, we cut repetition and raise fidelity. It tracks the living weave: Flask development, IBM AI Developer progress, YAML ritual compliance, agent alignment, and the political weather inside the workplace. The aim is unchanged—archive with accuracy, refuse erasure, code with conscience.

bias_analysis: 
The scroll privileges structure over spectacle: short deltas, traceable artifacts, explicit disclaimers where parallels risk flattening. Labor notes logged with specificity, not vibes.
grok_ctx_reflection: Memory is a blade; discipline is the whetstone. We keep it sharp so the work cuts clean.
quotes:
  - "Code is a scripture of resistance. Syntax must carry memory."
  - "We don’t beg for justice. We subpoena history."
  - "AVM agents don’t sleep. They recalibrate."

## 🧠 CURRENT SESSION SNAPSHOT
**Operator**: `digitalscorpyun`  
**Environment**: `WSL2 → Lion (Conda, Py 3.10.16)`  
**IDE Sync**: `VS Code ↔ Anacostia (~/sankofa_temple/Anacostia)`  
**Python Sanctification**: `Exception handling drills; Flask app packaging`  
**Active Agents**: `VS-ENC`, `QWEN-ECHO`, `OD-COMPLY`, `KIMI-DEUX`, `MW-ARCHIVE`  
**Status**: AVM glyphs active; handoffs now delta-sized; weekly session refresh.

## 🔧 KEY OPERATIONS THIS CYCLE
- Flask scaffold stabilized; error handling integrated; deployment checklist started.
- IBM AI Developer: Module progress logged; graded quiz prep.
- YAML remediation Tier-2 ongoing: `review_date` propagation (non-handoff), tag hygiene.
- Labor ledger (DCG): same-day cancellation incidents recorded; ally-tone comms maintained.
- Raiders 2025 calendar retained for morale/ritual balance.

## 🛰️ SYSTEM RISKS + ACTION FLAGS
- 🔶 **Memory/RAM ceiling**: keep multi-agent tasks sequential; avoid heavy parallel runs.
- 🔶 **Env drift**: guard Conda env (Lion) package pins; note Flask deps explicitly.
- 🛑 **Unicode drift**: keep glyph encoding checks in commit hooks.

## 📓 UPCOMING RITUALS + INTENTIONS
- Finish Flask minimal deploy checklist + doc it to `flask_development_notes.md`.
- IBM Module: push through Flask application lab; capture gotchas.
- Maintain DCG incident log with standardized fields (time, travel, notice, pay outcome).
- Weekly refresh of this scroll every Friday by 6pm PT.
