summary: A critique of the Supreme Court's 1876 ruling in United States v. Cruikshank, which dismantled federal authority to protect Black citizens and left them exposed to white mob violence during Reconstruction.
longform_summary: This scroll examines the Cruikshank decision as a legal rupture that nullified the Enforcement Acts, allowing white supremacist terrorism to flourish unchecked. It reveals how the Supreme Court, under the guise of constitutional restraint, sanctioned racial violence by absolving the federal government of its protective duty. Cruikshank helped shatter Reconstruction’s fragile gains and fortified the legal foundation of Jim Crow.

bias_analysis: This ruling codified impunity and exposed the moral void of postbellum constitutionalism. The note centers Black vulnerability and institutional betrayal over abstract legalism.
grok_ctx_reflection: Cruikshank is not just legal precedent—it is a scar encoded in American jurisprudence. Glyphs must remember where the law chose silence over justice.
quotes:
  - Federal protection disappeared almost immediately after the Cruikshank decision.
  - The state did not fail—it refused.
  - This wasn't judicial restraint. It was judicial abdication.
