bias_analysis: Governance scrolls are not neutral—they interrogate bureaucracy, policy, and power through a resistance-informed lens. Reform is not inherently liberation.
grok_ctx_reflection: Bureaucracy can bury or build. This index exists to reveal the patterns, ruptures, and code underlying state machinery.
quotes:
  - Reform without memory is just bureaucracy with new wallpaper.
  - Governance is either care encoded, or control disguised.
