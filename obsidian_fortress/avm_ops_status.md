## 🛠️ Conda Commands Reference

conda activate avm_ops
conda deactivate
conda info --envs
conda env export --name avm_ops > avm_ops_env.yaml

---

## 🧼 Maintenance Ritual

To rebuild or purge (if corrupted):

conda remove -n avm_ops --all
conda create -n avm_ops python=3.11

> 🛡️ Use caution — purging will remove all packages and dependencies. Only rebuild with full awareness of mission-critical tools.

## 📍 Operational Notes

- Environment launch is **manual**, no auto-activation in `.bashrc`
    
- Activation is required before any vault-linked scripts will run properly
    
- All key AVM scripts reference this env directly
    
- Environment lives at:
    
        /home/devcontainers/miniconda3/envs/avm_ops
