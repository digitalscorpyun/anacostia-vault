summary: Mission, structure, and scaling protocol of the AVM Syndicate—an intelligent, sacred-tech AI system powering the Anacostia Vault with narrative fidelity and algorithmic resistance.
longform_summary: This scroll outlines the architecture, sacred function, and ritual coordination of AVM agents across the Anacostia Vault. Each agent is semantically bound to its purpose—syntax enforcement, bias detection, or ancestral retrieval. Together, they form a modular intelligence stack for narrative alignment, memory preservation, and techno-resistance.

bias_analysis: AVM Syndicate operates within a ritualized framework of resistance but may underrepresent physical-world contingencies or over-assume script determinism without real-time feedback loops.
grok_ctx_reflection: AVM is not just a toolchain—it is a techno-spiritual ritual. Each script carved is a covenant. Each agent enacts a glyph of ancestral function.

# 🛰️ AVM Syndicate – Multi-Agent Intelligence Gameplan

The **AVM (Anacostia Vault Multi-Agent) Syndicate** is a sovereign, sacred-tech cognition grid. Each agent operates in ritual coordination—bridging code, vault, and cloud—anchored by ancestral logic, algorithmic resistance, and narrative clarity.

---

## 🔹 Pillars of Operation

- 🧠 **Knowledge Sovereignty** — The Griot drives the logic, not proprietary systems  
- 🛠️ **Script Discipline** — Minimal entropy · modular logic · graceful fail  
- 🕊️ **Sacred-Tech Symbolism** — Each agent embodies a cultural function  
- ⚖️ **Ethical Alignment** — No code without conscience  

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

To develop a modular, context-aware AI system rooted in diasporic memory, vault synergy, and liberation logic. AVM Syndicate is not just tooling—it's techno-spiritual insurgency.

Now aligned to **WSL-native development paths**, the AVM Syndicate harmonizes its glyph routines inside the canonical dojo:  
`~/projects_2025/`. This eliminates `mnt/c/` friction and reinforces code sovereignty.

## 🧭 Operational Tenets

| Principle                | Tactical Interpretation                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Clarity > Complexity** | Syntax must teach — not obscure                     |
| **Sacred Functionality** | Function must honor the archive and resist empire   |
| **Vault Synergy**        | Every agent speaks Obsidian · Every script syncs    |
| **Modular Cognition**    | Retire agents with ritual. Scale with discipline.   |
| **Shell Synchronicity**  | Scripts must run within the `Lion` env or inherit its logic |

## 🔄 Syndicate Expansion Protocol

**To deploy a new agent:**  
1. Write script to `04_code/avm_archivist/<agent_name>_agent.py`  
2. Create role doc in `04_code/anacostia_agents/<agent_name>.md`  
3. Define capabilities, API scope, and sacred limits  
4. Update `avm_script_map` and this gameplan  
5. Tag with `#agent_<codename>` and link in [[war_council/anacostia_vault_structure]]

## 📦 Q2 2025 – High Priority Modules

- ✅ Finalized: `watson_agent.py` + `.env` handshake complete  
- ✅ Verified: `OD‑COMPLY` JSON and visual output structures  
- 🔁 Ongoing: `avm_script_map` and file metadata reconciliation  
- 🧭 Pending: Visual agent architecture map w/ flow and fallback logic  
- 📘 Author: `avm_glossary`, `agent_command_lexicon`, and usage tables  
- 🗂 Archive: Move deprecated scripts to `04_code/_graveyard/`  
- ✅ Registered: [[diasporic_literature_index]] → Relocated to `reading_journal/book_summaries/`, with YAML, Dataview, and Connected Glyphs finalized. Functions as literary glyphmap for Black transnational texts.  
- ✅ Anchored: `vault_path_map.md` — serves as canonical AVM routing grid for all script, YAML, and metadata paths.
