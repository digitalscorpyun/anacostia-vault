summary: |
  VS-ENC delta handoff: Flask scaffolding stabilized, IBM AI course progress logged, Gaza‚ÄìAmos parallels guarded, MLK file analysis grounded, Raider Ops mapped, DCG labor notes archived. YAML compliance holding.
longform_summary: |
  Memory is stronger now, so this handoff is lighter: recording only the deltas. Flask dev moved from scaffold to stable local runs with ethical route checks. IBM AI Developer modules advanced (exception handling; Flask packaging). MLK file review re-centered on institutions over spectacle. Amos mapping retained as thematic signal, not one-to-one claims. Raider Ops calendar locked for Q3‚ÄìQ4 viewing. DCG cancellations noted as labor-control pattern; incident entries routed to `dgc_ops_sentinel.md`. YAML rituals sustained (review_date discipline; tag hygiene).

bias_analysis: |
  Routes audited for privacy and scope creep; MLK materials parsed to reduce conspiratorial drift; Amos parallels labeled as thematic only. Labor notes recorded with care to avoid overgeneralization while preserving pattern recognition.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Less ceremony, more signal: log the change, honor the truth, keep the rig light. The handoff is a stamp‚Äîproof the work happened and where it points next.

## üß© DELTA LOG (v2)
- **Flask**: scaffold ‚Üí stable local runs; error handling added; packaging notes updated.
- **IBM AI Dev**: progressed through exception handling + Flask module; quiz preps logged.
- **Labor Notes (DCG)**: same-day cancellation pattern documented to `dgc_ops_sentinel.md`.
- **YAML Discipline**: `review_date` enforcement continued (non-handoff notes only).
- **Raiders**: viewing calendar verified; MNF contingencies listed in Raider Ops block.

## ‚õ≥ DECISIONS
- Keep handoffs delta-sized; move narrative to `session_context.md`.
- Treat DCG cancellations as a recurring incident type with standardized fields.

## üì¶ ARTIFACTS
- `learning_journal/ibm_ai_developer/flask_development_notes.md` (updated)
- `work_ops/dgc_ops_sentinel.md` (incident entries appended)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS
- Low RAM friction on multi-agent runs; keep workflows lean.

## üöÄ NEXT 72H
- Flask: finalize minimal deploy checklist.
- IBM AI Dev: complete Module 2 graded items, start Flask app lab notes.
- Labor: maintain incident trail; keep Jerry comms ally-tone.
