summary: |
  VS-ENC delta handoff: Flask scaffolding stabilized, IBM AI course progress logged, Gaza‚ÄìAmos parallels guarded, MLK file analysis grounded, Raider Ops mapped, DCG labor notes archived. YAML compliance holding. 
  Extended August 27 session milestones: IBM AI Developer certification logged, r√©sum√© refactor complete, AI ethics framework anchored, workplace AI & cybercrime transcripts processed, Python Crash Course dict/glossary work advanced, *Once an Eagle* reflections archived.
longform_summary: |
  Memory is stronger now, so this handoff is lighter: recording only the deltas. Flask dev moved from scaffold to stable local runs with ethical route checks. IBM AI Developer modules advanced (exception handling; Flask packaging). MLK file review re-centered on institutions over spectacle. Amos mapping retained as thematic signal, not one-to-one claims. Raider Ops calendar locked for Q3‚ÄìQ4 viewing. DCG cancellations noted as labor-control pattern; incident entries routed to `dgc_ops_sentinel.md`. YAML rituals sustained (review_date discipline; tag hygiene).
  
  On August 27, major deltas recorded: certification milestone (IBM AI Developer) secured, r√©sum√© refactored for ATS compliance, AI Ethics Framework scroll established, transcripts on workplace AI and cybercrime converted to UBW + SankofaCut formats, Python dictionary/glossary exercises (6-1 through 6-4) completed, and ScorpyunStyle annotations added to *Once an Eagle*. Linked note discipline enforced; session recap archived as an AuditScroll.

bias_analysis: |
  Routes audited for privacy and scope creep; MLK materials parsed to reduce conspiratorial drift; Amos parallels labeled as thematic only. Labor notes recorded with care to avoid overgeneralization while preserving pattern recognition. August 27 deltas prioritized career development (certification), vault anchoring (AI ethics), and study/annotation tasks‚Äîbias toward systemic grounding over ad hoc notes.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Less ceremony, more signal: log the change, honor the truth, keep the rig light. 
  The handoff is a stamp‚Äîproof the work happened and where it points next. 
  August 27 additions show how personal milestones (certification, r√©sum√© polish) 
  tie directly into vault anchoring and cultural annotation. This is resistance through rhythm.

  - "No riot deployment, no moral drift."
  - "Build the rig. Feed the Vault. Light the way."
  - "Certification is not a badge‚Äîit is an anchor in the archive."

## üß© DELTA LOG (v2)
- **Flask**: scaffold ‚Üí stable local runs; error handling added; packaging notes updated.
- **IBM AI Dev**: progressed through exception handling + Flask module; quiz preps logged.
- **Labor Notes (DCG)**: same-day cancellation pattern documented to `dgc_ops_sentinel.md`.
- **YAML Discipline**: `review_date` enforcement continued (non-handoff notes only).
- **Raiders**: viewing calendar verified; MNF contingencies listed in Raider Ops block.

## ‚õ≥ DECISIONS
- Keep handoffs delta-sized; move narrative to `session_context.md`.
- Treat DCG cancellations as a recurring incident type with standardized fields.

## üì¶ ARTIFACTS
- `learning_journal/ibm_ai_developer/flask_development_notes.md` (updated)
- `work_ops/dgc_ops_sentinel.md` (incident entries appended)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS
- Low RAM friction on multi-agent runs; keep workflows lean.

## üöÄ NEXT 72H
- Flask: finalize minimal deploy checklist.
- IBM AI Dev: complete Module 2 graded items, start Flask app lab notes.
- Labor: maintain incident trail; keep Jerry comms ally-tone.

## üß© DELTA LOG (v3) ‚Äì August 27, 2025
- **Career Development**: IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate earned; r√©sum√© refactored ATS-safe; certification log created.  
- **Vault Anchors**: Authored `ai_ethics_framework.md`; added UBW + SankofaCut scrolls for workplace AI and cybercrime threats; logged UBW summary for AI in business.  
- **Python Study**: Completed Crash Course exercises 6-1 through 6-4; debugged dictionary syntax error; glossary loop output finalized.  
- **Literary Annotations**: Reflections on *Once an Eagle* epigraphs and excerpts logged using ScorpyunStyle. Clarified ‚Äúbrogue‚Äù reference in dialogue.  
- **Session Log**: Full milestone recap archived as AuditScroll.  

## ‚õ≥ DECISIONS (v3)
- Merge session milestones into terminal handoff to keep VS-ENC aligned.  
- Store literary reflections separately in `once_an_eagle_reflections.md` to reduce handoff bloat.  
- Cross-link AI ethics scrolls into defense dashboards.  

## üì¶ ARTIFACTS (v3)
- `ai_ethics/ai_ethics_framework.md`  
- `ai_ethics/generative_ai_in_workplace_risks.md`  
- `ai_ethics/generative_ai_in_business.md`  
- `cybersecurity_basics.md`  
- `literature/once_an_eagle_reflections.md`  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS (v3)
- High breadth of activities risks dilution of Vault focus; maintain anchor-first principle.  

## üöÄ NEXT 72H (v3)
- Add SankofaCut briefs to dashboards.  
- Continue IBM AI Developer applied labs (Flask deployment).  
- Build session log integration into `session_context.md`.  
- Monitor crosslinks for YAML compliance.
