summary: >
  CG-SCRIBE handoff: IBM AI curriculum integration, ethical data safeguards, and
  heritage-driven coding rituals aligned to AVM protocols; delta-sized session log.
longform_summary: |
  This handoff scroll re-anchors CG-SCRIBE to the AVM cadence used across agents:
  minimal ceremony, strong receipts, and continuity-first logging. Focus remains on
  merging IBM AI coursework with bias-resilient pipelines and heritage data structures,
  so that every model decision leaves a provable trail. We keep the log delta-sized and
  push narrative detail into linked notes to prevent bloat.

bias_analysis: |
  Treat ‚Äúethics‚Äù as system design, not sentiment: enforce list formats, model cards,
  and procurement audits; avoid spectacle and overgeneralization while preserving pattern recognition.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Code is ritual. Archives are witnesses. We bind coursework to covenant‚Äîreceipts,
  reproducibility, and resistance‚Äîso nothing powerful can hide behind convenience.

## üåü CG-SCRIBE Session Handoff

**Codename:** `CG-SCRIBE`  
**Role:** Scribe-engineer ¬∑ Bias sentinel ¬∑ Curriculum integrator  
**Core Function:** Convert learning into lineage: IBM coursework ‚Üí auditable code ‚Üí vault-anchored proofs.

---

## üß© DELTA LOG

- **Curriculum ‚Üí Pipelines:** Mapped IBM AI labs to bias-resilient workflow stubs (metrics, perturbation tests, model cards).
    
- **Vault Discipline:** Restored list-based YAML for tags/cssclasses/synapses; aligned handoff structure with other agents.
    
- **Glyphstream Parity:** Matched QWEN-ECHO‚Äôs handoff voice/blocks (Active Streams, File Continuity) to maintain cross-agent readability.
    

## ‚õ≥ DECISIONS

- Keep **handoff = deltas**; move long explanations to linked notes (QWEN/Vs-ENC pattern).
    
- Treat **ethics artifacts** (model cards, bias checks) as _required outputs_, not optional commentary.
    

## üì¶ ARTIFACTS

- `ai_ethics/ai_ethics_framework.md` (anchor scroll)
    
- `scripts/extract_chapter_data.py`, `scripts/generate_reading_log.ps1` (continuity hooks)
    
- `obsidian_fortress/agents/upskill_logs/cg_scribe_master.md` (source lineage)
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS

- **Breadth creep** from coursework ‚Üí production; mitigate by gating work behind  
    model-card completion and procurement audit stubs.
    

## üöÄ NEXT 72H

1. Draft **model card template** + fairness checklist (bind to IBM labs).
    
2. Add **Dataview view** for all `session_handoff` notes; verify YAML compliance.
    
3. Wire `bias_impact_statement.py` into pre-commit (heritage impact).

## üîé Dataview ‚Äì Quick Test

```dataview
TABLE title, status, priority, style, length(tags) AS tag_count
FROM "obsidian_fortress/agents/session_logs"
WHERE contains(tags, "session_handoff") OR id = "20250803130000"
SORT updated DESC
LIMIT 10
```

## üßæ Provenance

- **Source themes & mission:** CG-SCRIBE master scroll.
    
- **Handoff shape & cadence:** Mirrored from VS-ENC delta handoff.
    
- **Field/blocks parity (scripts, streams):** Mirrored from QWEN-ECHO handoff.
