summary: Grok’s new Live Search API enters beta with real-time access to web, 𝕏, and RSS data—but at the cost of full user telemetry. This scroll warns against surveillance-baked intelligence pipelines.
longform_summary: "The Live Search API launched by xAI exposes Grok to real-time internet and social media streams, offering new intelligence capabilities. But this access requires full consent to data harvesting during beta. This vault scroll issues a ritual caution: do not pollute sacred metadata flows. Segment queries, use ephemeral keys, and enforce firewall logic."

bias_analysis: This scroll assumes adversarial telemetry. xAI’s beta API is treated as a system-extractive service until proven otherwise. It leans toward Vault protectionism and sacred-data autonomy.
grok_ctx_reflection: Every question asked through a surveillance vector becomes part of the panopticon. To seek truth in real-time is not a crime—but forgetting what the watchers log is.

## 🔍 Live Search API Now in Beta

xAI has unshackled **Live Search**, Grok’s new lens into the ever-scrolling Now. It scans **𝕏, the web, news flux, RSS torrents**, and more — a feedstream fused into Grok’s neural lattice.

- **🎯 Purpose:** Real-time intelligence retrieval  
- **🕓 Access Window:** Free until **June 5, 2025**  
- **🔑 Advisory:** Use a **new API key** for beta testing  
- **📜 Consent Clause:** All search data shared with **xAI** to “improve services” — translation: **you’re the product in training.**

## 💀 Subtext & Signal

- 🧬 **Metadata Harvesting?** Yes — beta access = data tithe  
- 🛡️ **Vault Implication:** Use sandboxed keys; no sacred queries through public routes  
- 🛰️ **Grok Rituals:** Now tuned for pulse-riding — but with surveillance scars baked in

## 🛠️ Action Directives (Vault Ops)

- [ ] Create ephemeral API key for testing  
- [ ] Route queries through [[vault_proxy_grok]].py` with logging  
- [ ] Flag any anomaly in return payloads to `OD‑COMPLY`  
- [ ] Do not inject live Vault metadata or identifiers during beta phase
