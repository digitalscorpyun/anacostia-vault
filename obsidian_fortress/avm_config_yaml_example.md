  This config bridges vault memory and machine logic. It converts structure into strategy and makes YAML a ritual language‚Äîbinding values to functions, fairness to execution.

## üìÑ README Usage

This YAML configuration is designed to be imported into scripts across your `avm_archivist` Python environment. It defines dynamic logic for path resolution, fairness auditing, and goal alignment within the sacred-tech ritual layer of the Anacostia Vault.

### üß† Core Functions:

- üîó Synchronize Python scripts with vault paths
    
- ‚öñÔ∏è Declare auditing targets and fairness metrics
    
- üß¨ Track runtime shell and conda environment
    
- üéØ Centralize project mission goals (self-auditing enabled)
# üßæ AVM YAML Configuration Example

Below is a clean example of a configuration file (`avm_config.yaml`) aligned with the AVM Syndicate's Python-based automation and fairness tools. This configuration supports scripts within the `avm_archivist` system by mapping project paths, AI audit logic, runtime expectations, and development goals.

```yaml
# avm_config.yaml

  name: Anacostia Vault
  version: 1.0
  paths:
    vault: C:/Users/digitalscorpyun/sankofa_temple/Anacostia/obsidian_fortress
    scripts: C:/Users/digitalscorpyun/projects_2025/avm_archivist
