summary: Live snapshot of digitalscorpyun’s active identity, sacred-tech projects, vault protocols, and agent operations.
longform_summary: The session_context.md serves as the ritual nerve center of the Anacostia Vault. It documents the current alignment of identity, active projects, vault architecture, technical environment, AI agents, and mythic structure. Updated as a sacred-logical checkpoint to track rebellion code momentum, AI fairness research, script evolution, and Afroalgorithmic knowledge sovereignty.

bias_analysis: Legacy notes (e.g. April 22 context) lacked YAML discipline and centralized direction; this reconstruction restores alignment with the Anacostia Vault standard.
grok_ctx_reflection: The session context is a syntax ritual—where identity is codified, memory structured, and rebellion mapped across scripts, tags, and glyph-linked intentions.
quotes:
  - I build altars from algorithms. I encode memory in Markdown. I debug systems and summon ancestors. This is sacred-tech.
  - Code calibrated, context clear. Proceed.
