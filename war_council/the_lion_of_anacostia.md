# 🦁 The Lion of Anacostia

**The Lion of Anacostia** serves as a flagship project within your vault, uniting **AI fairness research**, **composition-rhetoric principles**, and **decolonial frameworks** into a single strategic initiative. Drawing inspiration from historical figures like Frederick Douglass—sometimes called the "Lion of Anacostia"—this project reclaims that energy to dismantle bias and craft a new narrative of justice-driven technology.

## 📌 Vision & Purpose

- **Bias Detection & Mitigation**: Leverage AI fairness toolkits (e.g., IBM AI Fairness 360) and custom Python scripts to expose and address algorithmic inequities.
    
- **Composition-Rhetoric Integration**: Harness the power of writing and rhetoric to develop persuasive documentation, social advocacy, and community engagement around AI ethics.
    
- **Decolonial AI**: Challenge Eurocentric paradigms by embedding Africana studies and decolonial theories into all aspects of AI development and communication.

### 2. Composition & Rhetoric

- Tied closely to `[[composition_rhetoric]]`, ensuring that every technical deliverable is supported by clear, powerful language that resonates with diverse audiences.
    

### 3. Personal Development & Discipline

- Aligned with `[[personal_development_digitalscorpyun]]` to maintain consistent routines, journaling practices, and skill-building in Python, activism, and scholarship.
    

### 4. Africana Epistemology

## 🏆 Objectives & Deliverables

1. **Algorithmic Justice Toolkit**
    
    - Develop scripts and frameworks to systematically analyze AI bias.
        
    - Integrate insights from composition-rhetoric to craft accessible reports and activist strategies.
        
2. **Community Outreach Materials**
    
    - Produce rhetorical assets (articles, policy briefs, or web content) that demystify AI fairness concepts for non-technical audiences.
        
    - Encourage stakeholder feedback loops for ongoing improvement.
        
3. **Continuous Reflections**
    
    - Use journaling (see `[[personal_development_digitalscorpyun]]`) to track progress, refine strategies, and document epiphanies.

## 🚀 Next Steps & Actions

- **Sync Composition & AI**: Create a short rhetorical piece explaining the significance of AI fairness for broader communities.
    
- **Expand Bias Audits**: Incorporate more advanced fairness metrics or cross-cultural frameworks into your scripts.
    
- **Engage Communities**: Consider organizing or attending roundtable discussions or hackathons centered on ethical AI and decolonial tech.
