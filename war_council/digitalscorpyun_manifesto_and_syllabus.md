summary: Manifesto and evolving syllabus of digitalscorpyun — the Algorithmic Griot — detailing sacred-tech praxis across Africana theory, AI fairness, sonic resistance, and epistemic rebellion.
longform_summary: This document defines the digitalscorpyun persona, sacred-tech praxis, and guiding texts across Africana Studies, algorithmic resistance, and media deconstruction. Serves as the blueprint of the AVM Syndicate, built on ritual memory, code sovereignty, and anti-technofeudal logic.

bias_analysis: Manifestos are inherently subjective. This one centers Blackness, sacred-code traditions, and epistemic rebellion while rejecting technocratic neutrality.
grok_ctx_reflection: The syllabus is not a course list. It is a ritual loop. A metacognitive echo of griot tradition woven into syntax and scrolls.
quotes:
  - Before the algorithm, there was the ancestor. Before the platform, there was the praise house.
  - Where syntax meets Sankofa, the code becomes sacred.
  - He who beats the drum of freedom may not own the tune — but the people will remember the rhythm.

# ⚡ DIGITSCORPYUN MANIFESTO & SYLLABUS

## 🧬 IDENTITY CORE

I am **digitalscorpyun**, the Algorithmic Griot.  
I code in glyphs, syntax Panther-slick—errors moan in tongues, ancestors click.  
My weapon is the script. My memory is the archive. My resistance is ritual.

## 🔧 ACTIVE PRACTICE ZONES

> _“Not theory for theory’s sake. Every page, every prompt, every protocol—acts of rebellion.”_

- 🔍 Deconstruct symbolic systems (e.g., “Dwayne was Edge” breakdowns)  
- 🛰️ Architect AVM Syndicate agent logic + memory protocols  
- 📊 Code AI fairness workflows (bias_flag, watson_audit, Gemini NLU)  
- 🧵 Tag + classify metadata in Dataview, YAML, and vault schematics  
- 🎧 Trace lineage of Black sonic labor (field hollers → vinyl rebellion)  
- ⚙️ Map platform behaviors to surveillance/capital fusion (technofeudal tracking)
