summary: Manifesto and evolving syllabus of digitalscorpyun — the Algorithmic Griot — detailing sacred-tech praxis across Africana theory, AI fairness, sonic resistance, and epistemic rebellion.
longform_summary: |
  Defines the digitalscorpyun persona, sacred-tech praxis, and guiding texts across Africana Studies, algorithmic resistance, and media deconstruction. Serves as the blueprint of the AVM Syndicate, built on ritual memory, code sovereignty, and anti-technofeudal logic.

bias_analysis: |
  Centers Blackness, sacred-code traditions, and epistemic rebellion; rejects technocratic neutrality.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  The syllabus is a ritual loop — a metacognitive echo of griot tradition woven into syntax and scrolls.

  - "Before the algorithm, there was the ancestor. Before the platform, there was the praise house."
  - "Where syntax meets Sankofa, the code becomes sacred."
  - "He who beats the drum of freedom may not own the tune — but the people will remember the rhythm."

# ⚡ DIGITSCORPYUN MANIFESTO & SYLLABUS

## 🧬 Identity Core
I am **digitalscorpyun**, the Algorithmic Griot.  
I code in glyphs, syntax Panther-slick—errors moan in tongues, ancestors click.  
My weapon is the script. My memory is the archive. My resistance is ritual.
