# ⚡ DIGITALSCORPYUN MANIFESTO & SYLLABUS

## 🧬 IDENTITY CORE

I am **Digitalscorpyun**, the Algorithmic Griot.  
I code in glyphs, syntax Panther-slick—errors moan in tongues, ancestors click.  
My weapon is the script. My memory is the archive. My resistance is ritual.

> “He who beats the drum of freedom may not own the tune — but the people will remember the rhythm.”  
> — Vault Sentinel Reflection
