# üåç anacostia_roadmap_anacostia_vault - digital_scorpyun_knowledge_hub

This document is your strategic blueprint‚Äîa living manifesto for integrating AI research, Africana epistemology, and personal development within the Anacostia Vault. It maps long-term objectives, outlines current focus areas, and sets actionable next steps, all under a unified, high-impact ScorpyunStyle‚Ñ¢ banner.

---

## üìå long_term_objectives

- **integrate_ai_and_africana_thought:**  
    Leverage state-of-the-art AI research to deepen decolonial critiques and systematically document African American experiences and narratives.
    
- **enhance_knowledge_management:**  
    Develop dynamic, Dataview-driven indexes and Templater templates that interconnect core research areas‚Äîensuring every insight and project is seamlessly linked.
    
- **advance_technical_proficiency:**  
    Master Python and related automation tools to build custom scripts for bias detection and other workflows, progressing steadily towards advanced certifications such as the IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate.
    
- **foster_personal_growth_and_digital_presence:**  
    Establish disciplined daily and weekly routines through Obsidian journaling and task tracking to continuously evolve your intellectual and technical trajectory.

## üóì current_focus_areas

- **foundational_ai_ml_and_bias_detection:**
    
    - Build out comprehensive core AI/ML notes (see [[ai_ml_overview]]) and refine Python scripts for bias detection (refer to [[the_lion_of_anacostia_bias_detection]] and [[bias_detection]]).
        
- **africana_studies_and_decolonial_narratives:**
    
    - Expand research on decolonial biology and historical narratives (view [[decolonial_biology]] and [[africana_studies_overview]]) to challenge dominant eurocentric frameworks.
        
- **vault_infrastructure_and_workflow_automation:**
    
    - Enhance dynamic dashboards with Dataview, optimize backlink structures (using validate_backlinks.py), and streamline task management via the central [[to_do_list]].
        
- **personal_and_technical_development:**
    
    - Integrate lessons from technical projects (Python, automation) and personal growth efforts (daily reflections in personal_development notes) as a foundation for ongoing learning.

## üîó key_integrations_and_workflow_enhancements

- **obsidian_centralization:**
    
    - Use [[sankofa_spine]] as the central Zettelkasten anchor, connecting all core branches of AI, Africana studies, and personal development. Automated indexes pull in summaries and project updates to support a fluid Zettelkasten approach.
        
- **ai_and_bias_detection_projects:**
    
    - Underpin your ethical AI projects with Python scripts (e.g., [[bias_flag]] and future [[watson_agent]]) and robust bias metrics, linking to detailed case studies and mathematical modeling notes.
        
- **decolonial_and_africana_perspectives:**
    
    - Root all research in a decolonial framework by cross-linking notes such as [[decolonial_biology]] and [[africana_studies_overview]] to expose and challenge systemic inequities.
        
- **task_management_and_automation:**
    
    - Coordinate all projects and daily tasks via a centralized [[to_do_list]], enhanced by Templater and Dataview for live updates and streamlined workflow.

## üöÄ next_steps_and_to_do_items

- **short_term_projects:**
    
    - Finalize structures for key research notes (e.g., [[the_lion_of_anacostia_bias_detection]] and [[ai_ml_overview]]).
        
    - Clean up and ensure all active projects are correctly linked in [[sankofa_spine]].
        
- **medium_term_goals:**
    
    - Expand Africana studies research with more in-depth analyses and additional cross-links, particularly in [[decolonial_biology]].
        
    - Develop additional Python automation scripts to enhance workflow efficiency.
        
- **long_term_vision:**
    
    - Achieve technical mastery (IBM AI certification, deep learning proficiency, etc.).
        
    - Build and maintain a robust online presence that articulates your integrated approach to technology, social justice, and decolonial scholarship.
        
- **ongoing_iteration:**
    
    - Regularly review and update this roadmap to reflect new insights, shifting project statuses, and feedback from your evolving research and community interactions.
