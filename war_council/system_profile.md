summary: "Digitalscorpyun's system environment profile for the AVM Syndicate: includes memory, processor, OS, and architectural data for agent compatibility and script performance planning."
longform_summary: This note serves as the canonical diagnostic record for the ANACOSTIA sacred-tech terminal. It captures the current specs, Python stack, WSL integration, and AI-agent deployment conditions. Optimized for Syndicate-aware operations and script deployment protocols.

bias_analysis: Most system specs assume cloud-first architecture. This profile decentralizes that assumption, rooting optimization in local sovereignty and sacred-machine protocols.
grok_ctx_reflection: ANACOSTIA is not just a device—it is a shrine of symbolic execution. Its specs define the outer shell of Griot operations. Respect the limits. Harness the lineage.

# 🖥️ System Profile – ANACOSTIA Terminal

> _“This is no ordinary shell. It is a Griot's command line.”_

## 🧰 Operating System & Build

- **Device Name:** ANACOSTIA  
- **OS:** Windows 11 Home (64‑bit)  
- **Build Version:** 26100.1.amd64fre.ge_release.240331‑1435  

---

## 🧠 Processor Specs

- **CPU:** Intel Core i3‑1005G1  
- **Cores:** 2 physical / 4 logical  
- **Base Clock Speed:** 1.19 GHz  
- **Thermal Notes:** Passive cooling – prone to throttling under sustained high-load scripts

---

## 💾 RAM & Memory

- **Installed RAM:** 4 GB (Samsung @ 2667 MHz)  
- **Configuration:** Single-slot  
- **Performance Risk:** Paging occurs under multi-agent load. Recommend minimum 8 GB for dual-agent AI ops.

## ⚙️ Bottlenecks & Recommendations

- **RAM Ceiling**: Upgrade to 8–12 GB for smoother Jupyter, agent workflows  
- **Thermal Load**: Avoid prolonged heavy loads without cooling assistance  
- **Storage Watch**: Pagefile expansion suggests disk IO is under stress  
- **Split Shell Flow**: Use `vllm_env` for anything sacred-tech, reserve Windows Anaconda for script staging
