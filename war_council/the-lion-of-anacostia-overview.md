# 🦁 The Lion of Anacostia – Project Overview

**The Lion of Anacostia** is not a tool. It’s a stance.  
Rooted in Frederick Douglass’ indomitable spirit and updated for the algorithmic age, this flagship initiative connects **Sunday-based media scraping**, **Africana futurity**, and **ethical resistance** into one coherent archive-driven practice.

This is the fire, the feed, and the framing.

---

## 🔥 Vision Shift

This initiative now centers:

- **Selective Article Scraping**: The `lion_scraper.py` script is now a Sunday sentinel—retrieving major headlines from trusted Black, progressive, and cultural sources for personal digestion and future annotation.

- **Curation Over Crawling**: No longer concerned with AI bias audits—this phase is about self-curated context, not external compliance. The lion hunts what matters to *you*, not what the system says should matter.

- **Narrative Reclamation**: Each article pulled is potential fuel for Black thought, poetic response, or vault integration into `01_africana_frontlines`.

---

## 🧰 Core Components

### 🐍 `lion_scraper.py`  
- Revised to include **Sunday Mode** for focused, recurring weekend runs  
- Scrapes headline-level articles from a curated site list  
- Outputs CSV and TXT logs for ingestion into Obsidian or Dataview

### 📚 `01_africana_frontlines`  
- Formerly `100_africana_studies`  
- Hosts headlines, cultural analysis, and annotated research drawn from weekly scrapes

### ✍🏽 Rhetorical Integration  
- Supports GriotBox summaries, ScorpyunStyle reflections, and decolonial commentary  
- May seed future articles, threads, or AVM agent briefings

---

## 🚀 Next Moves

- [ ] Implement `--sunday` mode in `lion_scraper.py`  
- [ ] Clean up old selector configs no longer in use  
- [ ] Automate import of logs into vault using `import_sunday_scrape.py` (TBD)  
- [ ] Begin tagging extracted entries with `#africana_frontlines` + `#lion_scrape`

## ✨ Why It Still Roars

> _“I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.”_  
— Frederick Douglass

Digitalscorpyun has always walked that razor’s edge—between code and conviction, rhythm and recursion.  
**The Lion of Anacostia** remains your call to witness, your tech-assisted roar in the wilderness of noise.
