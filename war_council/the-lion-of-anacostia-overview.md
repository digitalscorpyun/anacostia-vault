summary: "Flagship initiative rooted in Frederick Douglass‚Äô spirit, designed to curate, reclaim, and archive Africana narratives through Sunday scraping rituals."
longform_summary: |
  The Lion of Anacostia initiative reframes scraping not as blind automation but as curated resistance. Powered by `lion_scraper.py`, it executes Sunday runs to gather headlines from culturally significant and progressive outlets. These scrapes seed Africana-focused analysis, ScorpyunStyle reflections, and vault integration under `01_africana_frontlines`. This project continues Douglass‚Äô legacy of principled witness while embedding Africana futurity into sacred-tech practice.

  The Lion is not compliance code. It is rhythm encoded: a Sunday ritual that filters chaos into clarity, hunting for signal in Black, progressive, and cultural sources.

# ü¶Å The Lion of Anacostia ‚Äì Project Overview

**The Lion of Anacostia** is not a tool. It‚Äôs a stance.  
Rooted in Frederick Douglass‚Äô indomitable spirit and updated for the algorithmic age, this flagship initiative connects **Sunday-based media scraping**, **Africana futurity**, and **ethical resistance** into one coherent archive-driven practice.

This is the fire, the feed, and the framing.

## üî• Vision Shift

This initiative now centers:

- **Selective Article Scraping**: The `lion_scraper.py` script is now a Sunday sentinel‚Äîretrieving major headlines from trusted Black, progressive, and cultural sources for personal digestion and future annotation.
- **Curation Over Crawling**: No longer concerned with AI bias audits‚Äîthis phase is about self-curated context, not external compliance. The lion hunts what matters to *you*, not what the system says should matter.
- **Narrative Reclamation**: Each article pulled is potential fuel for Black thought, poetic response, or vault integration into `01_africana_frontlines`.
