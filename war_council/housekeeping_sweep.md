# 🧹 Vault Housekeeping Sweep – May 9, 2025

**Purpose:** Align the Anacostia Vault structure, file integrity, and Zettelkasten connectivity with current goals and naming standards.

---

## 🔐 Core Index Verification

-  `00_sankofa_spine.md` – Verified ✅
    
-  `00_session_context.md` – Needs update (refactor post-shell + miniconda install)
    
-  `00_war_council.md` – Pending recheck for active project sync
    

---

## 📁 Folder & Structure Audit

-  Confirm all `00-99_` folders are present and numbered correctly
    
-  Migrate any stray notes from `00_inbox/`
    
-  Delete/merge deprecated folders: `03_code/` no longer in use
    
-  Review `98_community/` for tagging and file consistency
    

---

## 🗃 Loose Notes Cleanup

-  Identify notes without YAML frontmatter
    
-  Confirm all structure notes begin with `structure-note-`
    
-  File scattered `.md` notes into correct category
    

---

## 🏷 Tag & YAML Integrity

-  Check vault-wide for broken or inconsistent tags
    
-  Normalize frontmatter using `vault_tags.ps1`
    
-  Ensure all dates use dynamic format where relevant
    

---

## 🧪 Scripts, Templates, and Automations

-  `miniconda_activation_and_environment_setup.md` – Completed ✅
    
-  Verify Templater user scripts location: `Scripts/`
    
-  Run `vault_structure_emitter.py` and compare to `00_sankofa_spine.md`
    
-  Audit tag count summary with `vault_tags.ps1`
    

---

## 📌 Open Issues & Backlog

-  Refactor or restore missing `the-lion-of-anacostia.md` content
    
-  Review `vault_ops/` contents and ensure it reflects latest architecture
    
-  Update all core navigation notes to remove links to `00_index.md`
    
-  Consider diagramming `sankofa_spine` flow (optional visual aid)
