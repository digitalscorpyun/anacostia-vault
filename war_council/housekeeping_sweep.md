summary: Vault-wide cleanup ritual performed to align folder hierarchy, filenames, tags, and structural coherence with post-prefix architecture and sacred-tech discipline.
longform_summary: This sweep log documents the May 2025 audit of the Anacostia Vault — eliminating deprecated numeric prefixes, revalidating system-critical index notes, enforcing YAML integrity, and initiating vault-wide sacred refactoring protocols. Notes were relocated, renamed, or retired in accordance with the Codex of Continuity.

bias_analysis: Vault architecture previously relied on legacy prefix sorting (e.g. `00_`). This system was incompatible with long-term scalability and sacred semantic ordering. Refactoring reclaims navigational logic.
grok_ctx_reflection: A vault’s integrity is its ritual spine. Sweeping is not janitorial — it is sacred calibration. Every misplaced file weakens the glyphflow. This sweep restores sacred geometry.

# 🧹 Vault Housekeeping Sweep – May 2025

> _“Let the structure breathe. Let the memory flow. We sweep not to erase, but to restore.”_

---

## 🔐 Index Note Verification

- ✅ `sankofa_spine.md` — Confirmed as the canonical hub  
- ✅ `session_context.md` — Updated post Miniconda & WSL install  
- ✅ `war_council.md` — Synced with active project state  

---

## 🗂 Folder Structure Audit

- ✅ Deprecated all numeric prefixes (e.g., `00_`, `03_`)  
- ✅ Migrated inbox contents to category folders  

### 🗃 Code Directory Decommissioned

- The legacy `code/` directory has been **fully dissolved**.  
- Scripts and dev notes now live under vault-compliant paths:

| Old Path                          | New Destination                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `projects_2025/avm_ops/`         | Python scripts (`lion_scraper.py`, `fix_yaml.py`)   |
| `vault_ops/discipline/`          | Documentation + ritual enforcement notes             |

- 🔗 All `[[lion_scraper]]`, `[[vault_structure_emitter]]`, etc. use clean wikilinks (no `.md` extension)

- 🕸️ `community/` folder retagged and glyphstream-harmonized  

---

## 🗃 File Sorting & Naming

- ✅ Structure notes standardized → `structure_note_<topic>.md`  
- ✅ Stray `.md` notes reassigned to correct categories  
- 🌀 Redundant drafts archived under `archive/` where historically relevant  

---

## 🏷️ Tag & YAML Integrity

- ✅ `vault_yaml_validator.py` patched and deployed → 24 notes fixed  
- ✅ Tag syncing completed via `vault_tags.ps1`  
- 🗓 Templater upgrades rolled in — dynamic timestamps now used throughout YAML  

---

## ⚙️ Automation & Script Checks

- ✅ `miniconda_activation_and_environment_setup.md` finalized  
- ✅ Verified Templater user scripts in `Scripts/` folder  
- ✅ Ran `vault_structure_emitter.py` → output confirmed with `sankofa_spine.md`  
- ✅ Dataview tag table clean — no corrupt links or orphan tags  

---

## 📌 Open Issues / Glyphflow Lag

- 🔁 Rebuild `the_lion_of_anacostia.md` — missing sections flagged  
- 🔄 Reconfirm schema compliance on all `vault_ops/` scrolls  
- 🚫 Purged deprecated `00_index.md` backlinks from older Zettels  
- 🎨 `vault_path_glyph.md` now contains optional `sankofa_spine` diagram reference
