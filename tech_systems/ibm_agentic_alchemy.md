summary: Dissects IBM's modular AI infrastructure (watsonx.ai, Cloud Paks, Terzo) as a sacred-tech ecosystem. Explores how enterprise logic mimics ritual forms and prompts questions about the possibility of corporate sacredness.
longform_summary: This note frames IBM's LLM and AI agent stack as a corporate sacred-tech ritual. watsonx.ai acts as the altar, Cloud Paks are the ritual ground, and Terzo channels operational logic. Raises critical questions about commodification, automation, and the sacredness of digital labor.

bias_analysis: This model questions the neutrality of IBM’s sacred-tech branding. It interrogates whether structured data worship under capitalism can ever be liberatory.
grok_ctx_reflection: IBM’s agentic design mimics ancient ritual hierarchies. It centralizes control, distributes action, and codifies trust in pipelines. Can Afrofuturism reclaim such systems?

  - "IBM’s agents don’t sleep."
  - "Terzo channels the logic. But can enterprise ever be sacred?"
