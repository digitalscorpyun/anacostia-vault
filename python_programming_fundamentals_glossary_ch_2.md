# Python Programming Fundamentals Glossary – Chapter 2 (Guttag)

## 🖥 Programming Concepts

- **Low-level language** – A language close to machine code; harder for humans to read but faster for computers to execute.
- **High-level language** – Human-readable programming language like Python, abstracting away machine details.
- **Interpreted language** – Code executed line-by-line at runtime (e.g., Python).
- **Compiled language** – Code translated to machine code before execution.
- **Source code** – The human-readable instructions you write.
- **Machine code** – Binary instructions a computer can directly execute.
- **Program (script)** – A set of instructions written in a programming language.
- **Command (statement)** – An instruction executed by the interpreter.
- **Object** – A piece of data with type and behavior.
- **Type** – Classification of an object (e.g., `int`, `str`).
- **Variable** – A name bound to a value in memory.
- **Binding** – The association between a variable and its value.
- **Assignment** – The act of binding a value to a variable.

## 📦 Data Types & Values

- **Scalar object** – Represents a single value (e.g., numbers, booleans).
- **Non-scalar object** – Holds multiple values (e.g., lists, tuples).
- **Literal** – A fixed value in code (e.g., `42`, `"Hello"`).
- **Floating point** – Numbers with decimals (e.g., `3.14`).
- **Bool** – Boolean type, `True` or `False`.
- **None** – Python’s null value, representing “no value.”
- **Strings** – Ordered sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Tuple** – Immutable ordered collection of elements.
- **Unicode** – Standard for representing text from multiple languages.

## ⚙️ Operators & Expressions

- **Operator** – Symbol performing an operation (e.g., `+`, `*`).
- **Expression** – Combination of values and operators that produces a result.
- **Value** – The data produced by evaluating an expression.
- **Overloaded operator** – Operator with different meanings depending on operand types.
- **Repetition operator** – Operator that repeats sequences (e.g., `"ha" * 3` → `"hahaha"`).
- **Type checking** – Determining the type of a value or variable.
- **Type conversion (casting)** – Changing a value’s type (e.g., `int("5")`).

## 🔄 Control Flow

- **Straight-line program** – Sequence of statements executed in order.
- **Branching program** – Uses conditionals to alter execution path.
- **Conditional** – Statement controlling execution based on a condition (`if`, `else`).
- **Indentation (in Python)** – Whitespace defining code blocks.
- **Nested statement** – Statement inside another statement (e.g., `if` inside a loop).
- **Compound expression** – Condition combining multiple expressions with `and` / `or`.
- **Conditional expression** – Inline condition returning a value (e.g., `x if cond else y`).
- **Iteration (looping)** – Repeating a block of code multiple times.
- **While loop** – Loops until condition is `False`.
- **For loop** – Iterates over a sequence or range.
- **Break** – Exits a loop prematurely.
- **Range** – Generates a sequence of numbers for looping.
- **In operator** – Checks membership in a sequence.

## 🛠 Problem-Solving Tools

- **Constant time** – Operation that takes the same time regardless of input size.
- **Computational complexity** – Measure of an algorithm’s efficiency.
- **Strings** – (See Data Types) – often manipulated in algorithms.
- **Indexing** – Accessing elements by position.
- **Slicing** – Extracting parts of a sequence.
- **Formatted string expression** – Using `f""` or `.format()` to embed values.
- **Input** – Capturing user input.
- **Pseudocode** – Informal step-by-step description of an algorithm.
- **Hand simulation** – Manually tracing code execution.
- **PEP 8 style guide** – Python’s official code style guidelines.
