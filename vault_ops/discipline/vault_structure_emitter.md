# 🧠 `vault_structure_emitter.py`

> _“The vault doesn't hide mistakes. It just waits for us to name them.”_  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Emits a markdown map of the Anacostia Vault directory structure and audits for deprecated numeric prefixes (`01_`, `02-`, etc.). This ritual ensures structural clarity, supports folder hygiene, and outputs reports for vault compliance.

---

## 🧰 Invocation

```bash
python vault_structure_emitter.py
---

## 📦 Outputs

- `anacostia_vault_structure.md` – Visual snapshot of the entire vault layout
    
- `prefix_audit_report.txt` – Report flagging any noncompliant prefixed folders or files
    

---

## 🚫 Exclusion Rules

- Ignores: `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.DS_Store`, and any hidden/system files
    
- Enforces: No leading numeric prefixes allowed in vault file/folder names
    

---

## ⚙️ Logic Flow (Python Pseudocode)

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_markdown()
```

Script performs:

1. Recursive scan of `ROOT_PATH`
    
2. Formats vault structure as a nested markdown list
    
3. Detects prefix violations and logs them
    
4. Emits two files into `obsidian_fortress/`

Let me know if you want the `vault_path_glyph.md` section to pull in its summary dynamically or style the output file section as a table.
