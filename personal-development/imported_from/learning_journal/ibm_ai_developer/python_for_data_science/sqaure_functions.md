summary: |
  Deep breakdown of a beginner function that squares a number, adds 1, and returns the result. Includes variable tracing, print behavior, and why the return statement ends the function.
longform_summary: |
  This note clarifies confusion surrounding a basic Python function named `square()` that performs the operation a * a + 1. It includes a walkthrough of each line, the role of return, why certain lines aren't executed after return, and how to rename the function for semantic clarity. It also distinguishes between calling a function and merely defining it.

bias_analysis: |
  No external data bias detected. This is a pure code behavior analysis based on Python 3.x function execution logic.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Code execution logic is not always intuitive for learners. The term 'square' misled the expectation. Naming a function without capturing its true intent invites confusion. This entry restores clarity to the invocation ritual.
quotes:
  - "Return is the exit wound of a function."
  - "A function that misnames itself will confuse even its creator."

## üß™ Function Call and Output

```python
x = 3
y = square(x)
```

**Console Output:**

```
3 if you square + 1 10
```

**Value of `y`:**

```python
10
```

---

## üîç Walkthrough

1. `a = 3`
    
2. `b = 1`
    
3. `c = a * a + b = 3 * 3 + 1 = 10`
    
4. The `print` function runs.
    
5. `return(c)` exits the function and passes the result to the caller.
    
6. Any code **after `return` is not executed**.

## üîÑ Misleading Function Name

Despite being called `square`, this function **does not** simply square the number ‚Äî it **squares it and adds 1**.

### ‚úÖ Better Name:

```python
def square_plus_one(a):
    return a * a + 1
```

---

## üß† Final Insight

Calling the function runs it. Defining it stores it.  
Returning a value exits the function ‚Äî and anything after that line is ignored unless caught **before** `return`.
