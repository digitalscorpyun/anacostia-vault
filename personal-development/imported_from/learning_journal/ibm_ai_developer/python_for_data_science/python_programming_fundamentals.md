# ðŸ§  Python Programming Fundamentals â€” Glossary

Welcome! This alphabetized glossary captures core terms from the IBM AI Developer program along with broader industry terminology essential for fluency in Python.

---

### A

- **Analogy**  
  A concept or comparison outside the scope of programming used to explain one idea in terms of another.

- **Attributes**  
  Characteristics or properties of an object, accessed via dot notation (e.g., `object.attribute`).

---

### B

- **Branching**  
  Altering program flow based on conditions using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

---

### C

- **Comparison operators**  
  Used to compare values and return Boolean results (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`).

- **Conditions**  
  Expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`, directing code execution flow.

---

### E

- **Enumerate**  
  Built-in function that returns both index and value during iteration.

- **Exception handling**  
  Mechanism to catch and handle errors using `try`, `except`, `finally`.

- **Explicitly**  
  Doing something in a clear and direct manner, leaving no ambiguity in code behavior.

---

### F

- **For loops**  
  Iterates over items in a sequence (list, string, tuple, etc.) with predictable iteration count.

---

### G

- **Global variable**  
  Declared outside functions; accessible across the entire script unless shadowed.

---

### I

- **Incremented**  
  Increasing a variable's value using `+=` or `x = x + 1`.

- **Indent**  
  Leading whitespace that defines code blocks in Python.

- **Indices**  
  Numerical positions of elements in sequences (starting from 0).

- **Iterate**  
  Repeating actions over elements in a collection.

---

### L

- **Local variables**  
  Declared within a function or block; not accessible outside.

- **Logic operators**  
  Boolean logic: `and`, `or`, `not`.

- **Loops**  
  Constructs (`for`, `while`) for repeating a block of code.

---

### P

- **Parameters**  
  Named variables in function definitions used to receive input values.

- **Programming Fundamentals**  
  Core principles including variables, control flow, functions, I/O, and error handling.

---

### R

- **Range function**  
  Generates a sequence of numbers (`range(start, stop, step)`).

---

### S

- **Scope of function**  
  The area in which a variable is recognized; local, global, or enclosed.

- **Sequences**  
  Ordered collections (e.g., list, tuple, string) that support iteration and indexing.

- **Syntax**  
  Rules for structuring code so itâ€™s interpretable by the Python interpreter.

---

### W

- **While loops**  
  Repeats a block of code as long as a condition remains `True`.

---

ðŸŒ€ **Glossary complete.** This scroll serves as a reference glyphâ€”meant to be consulted, updated, and wielded as your programming fluency grows.
