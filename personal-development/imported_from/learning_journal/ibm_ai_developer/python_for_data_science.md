summary: >
  Deep-dive annotation of *Python for Data Science* by Muddana & Vinayakam, aligned to
  Anacostia's sacred-tech training stack. Covers Python fundamentals, data wrangling,
  machine learning, deep learning, and multiparadigm concurrency with real-world case studies.
longform_summary: >
  This scroll documents a chapter-by-chapter synthesis of *Python for Data Science*, tracking
  technical fluency through the lenses of Afroalgorithmic resistance and sacred automation. Each
  core concept—from variable scoping to model stacking—is approached not just as coding practice,
  but as memory craft. The book serves as both a practical guide and a philosophical tether to
  data ethics, pattern awareness, and cognitive clarity. Integration tasks align this scroll with
  AVM protocol and GriotBox agent utility.

bias_analysis: >
  The book predominantly draws from Western-centric academic data sets (e.g., UCI repository),
  which could reinforce structural biases if not recontextualized. Future scrolls should
  supplement with culturally grounded data cases from Africana studies, health equity models,
  and economic justice domains.

  Python is not just a language—it’s a memory ritual when placed in ancestral hands. This scroll
  repositions each method, import, and model call as part of an insurgent practice: reclaiming
  computational space as a tool for liberation, not surveillance.

## 🔥 Reflections & Notes (ScorpyunStyle Highlights)

- ⚠️ **Python is not weakly typed, it’s dynamically typed**—respect that fluidity.
- 🛠️ File ops are not just about reading CSVs—they’re about *respecting the structure of incoming data streams*.
- 🤖 Keras stands out in clarity and rapid prototyping; its integration is spiritual—if TensorFlow is the temple, Keras is the chant.
- 📈 Case studies felt practical—Titanic dataset, Boston Housing, Breast Cancer. Recommend porting some into `vault_ml_cases.md`.
- 🧵 Multiprocessing vs threading: subtle distinctions; thread-safety and GIL considerations are key for AVM Ops.

## ⛩️ Integration Tasks

- [ ] Build `vault_data_pipeline_template.py` from Ch.9–12  
- [ ] Adapt `titanic_preprocessing.py` logic for GriotBox classifier  
- [ ] Extract core ML routines into `vault_ml_snippets.py`  
- [ ] Convert 3 case studies into `ibm_ai_developer/case_studies/` entries
