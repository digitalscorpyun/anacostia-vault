### **1. Create a dedicated scroll for the project**

Path:

bash

CopyEdit

`learning_journal/ibm_ai_developer/emotion_detector_final_project.md`

This scroll will track:

- **Project purpose & tasks** (the 8 steps from the overview)
    
- **Command history** (everything you run — mkdir, git commits, installs, etc.)
    
- **Decisions & rationale** (why we structured directories, version choices, etc.)
    
- **Issues & fixes** (like the credential-manager-core git message)
    
- **Final submission notes** (screenshots, peer review prep).

### **2. Use ScorpyunStyle sections**

- **Key Takeaways** (progress in human terms)
    
- **Context** (why we’re doing each step)
    
- **Main Moves** (commands + explanations)
    
- **Why It Matters** (for your workflow/future projects)
    

---

### **3. Keep Git commits tied to documentation**

Each commit should correspond to a logged step in the scroll. That way, the Vault becomes the narrative of the repo.

Do you want me to **draft the initial scroll (YAML + scaffold)** right now so we can start populating as we go? I can make it fully Vault‑compliant (your 20‑field YAML schema) and set it up for live updating as we work
