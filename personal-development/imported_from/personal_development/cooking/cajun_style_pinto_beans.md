Cajun-style pinto beans are a flavorful, hearty dish with a spicy, smoky, and aromatic profile, typical of Louisiana Cajun cuisine. Here’s a classic recipe to make them at home:

### **Cajun-Style Pinto Beans Recipe**  
**Prep Time:** 10 mins (plus soaking time if using dried beans)  
**Cook Time:** 1.5–2 hours (or 6–8 hours in a slow cooker)  
**Servings:** 6–8  

#### **Ingredients:**  
- 1 lb (2 cups) dried pinto beans (or 3 cans, drained & rinsed)  
- 6 cups water or chicken broth (plus more as needed)  
- 1 large onion, diced  
- 1 green bell pepper, diced  
- 2 celery stalks, diced (the "Cajun holy trinity")  
- 4 garlic cloves, minced  
- 12 oz andouille sausage or smoked sausage, sliced (optional for meat version)  
- 1 ham hock, smoked turkey leg, or ½ lb tasso ham (for extra flavor)  
- 2 bay leaves  
- 1 tsp dried thyme  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper (adjust for heat)  
- 1 tsp black pepper  
- 1 tbsp Cajun seasoning (like Tony Chachere’s or homemade blend)  
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 1 tbsp hot sauce (like Crystal or Tabasco)  
- Salt to taste  
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsley or green onions (for garnish)  
- Cooked white rice (for serving)  

#### **Instructions:**  
1. **Prepare the Beans:**  
   - If using dried beans, rinse and soak overnight in water (or use the quick-soak method: boil for 2 mins, then let sit for 1 hour). Drain.  
   - If using canned beans, drain and rinse (reduce cook time to 30–40 mins).  

2. **Sauté the Trinity & Meat:**  
   - In a large pot or Dutch oven, brown the sausage (if using) over medium heat. Remove and set aside.  
   - In the same pot, sauté onion, bell pepper, and celery until soft (5 mins). Add garlic and cook 1 minute.  

3. **Simmer the Beans:**  
   - Add soaked beans, broth/water, sausage, ham hock (if using), bay leaves, thyme, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper, Cajun seasoning, Worcestershire, and hot sauce.  
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1.5–2 hours (until beans are tender), stirring occasionally. Add water if needed.  

4. **Adjust & Serve:**  
   - Once beans are soft, remove the bay leaves and ham hock (shred any meat and return to pot).  
   - Mash some beans lightly to thicken the broth. Adjust salt and spice to taste.  
   - Serve over rice, garnished with parsley or green onions.  

#### **Tips:**  
- **Slow Cooker:** Combine all ingredients (except salt) and cook on LOW 6–8 hours.  
- **Vegetarian Option:** Omit meat, use veggie broth, and add liquid smoke for depth.  
- **Extra Heat:** Add diced jalapeños or more cayenne.  

These beans are even better the next day! Perfect with cornbread or as a side to grilled meats. Enjoy your taste of Cajun country! 🌶️🍚
