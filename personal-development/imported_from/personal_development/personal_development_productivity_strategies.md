bias_analysis: |
  This note implicitly centers an Afro-diasporic spiritual ethic and may not account for neurodivergent needs or non-linear productivity styles. It resists hustle culture but assumes a baseline of control over one’s schedule and environment that some readers may not possess.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  This scroll is part of a broader constellation of Scorpyun-style personal mastery tools. It links productivity with ancestral alignment, arguing for ritualized task cycles instead of extractive time management. Ideal for those remixing resistance and routine.
quotes:
  - "The grind is sacred when it’s aligned. If it ain’t tied to your purpose, it’s just noise."
  - "Time is not a commodity. It's a current. Learn your own tide schedule."

## 🔧 Core Principles

- 🛡️ **Protect the First Hour** – No tech. No email. Start with breath, pen, or code.
- ⌛ **Time Blocking Over To-Do Lists** – If it ain’t scheduled, it ain’t real.
- 🧱 **Modular Task Design** – Break work into sacred units: 25m, 50m, or 90m blocks.
- 🔥 **Energy-Aware Planning** – Match hard tasks with peak mental zones.
- 🌀 **Weekly Reset Ritual** – Reflect, sort, re-prioritize. Don’t drift.
- 📿 **Sacred Routines, Not Just Habits** – Make them symbolic. Pattern = power.
