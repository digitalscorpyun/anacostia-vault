summary: An index of etymological fragments and phrase origins tracked across the Anacostia Vault, including euphemisms, idioms, and power-coded language used historically or strategically.
longform_summary: "This lexicon anchors the hidden meanings embedded in everyday terms—especially those weaponized, whitened, or worn down by empire. These etymologies are memory reclamation points: language that once stung, summoned, or resisted."
