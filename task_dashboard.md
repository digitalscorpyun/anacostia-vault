summary: Dynamic Dataview-powered task dashboard pulling live to-dos from the Anacostia Vault.
longform_summary: >
  This dashboard aggregates and visualizes all incomplete tasks from core war-council lists
  and project scrolls, grouped by sections, due dates, and source notes. It respects YAML
  metadata (title, category, status, priority) and enforces Scorpyun discipline for sacred-tech ops.

from "00_war_council/to_do_list"
flatten file.tasks as t
where !t.completed
sort t.section asc, t.text asc
