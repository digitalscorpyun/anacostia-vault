bias_analysis: This scroll centers diasporic, queer, and radical Black voices while deconstructing mainstream platform bias. It actively resists digital respectability narratives and flattening of identity.
grok_ctx_reflection: Black identity online is not just expressed—it is policed, remixed, and weaponized. The web is a battlefield of selfhood, where code, culture, and surveillance collide.
quotes:
  - The Black digital body is both user and target.
  - To exist online while Black is to speak in glyphs and be parsed by ghosts.
  - Blackness is not a demographic—it’s a cipher.

# 🌐 The Black Identity Web

This scroll traces how Black identity is constructed, suppressed, and radicalized across digital platforms—social media, streaming algorithms, data repositories, and AI corpora.

---

## 🧠 Research Vectors

### 1. **Digital Diaspora**
- Black communities form online for solidarity, mourning, and celebration  
- Hashtag networks (e.g., `#BlackTwitter`, `#SayHerName`) as modern-day oral traditions  
- Afrofuturism online creates **imaginative sovereignty**

---

### 2. **Algorithmic Policing**
- Shadowbanning, voice suppression, and banned dialects  
- AAVE often flagged as spam or low-quality by LLMs and moderation bots  
- GPTs trained to standardize expression strip nuance from Black discourse

---

### 3. **Platform Power & Resistance**
- Black TikTok strikes resist uncredited trend theft  
- Meme culture as weapon of resistance (e.g., George Floyd murals, AI portraits)  
- Web 3 and decentralized spaces as new frontiers for unpoliced expression
