summary: A timeline-based vault scroll tracking landmark texts in diasporic literature — charting memory, resistance, and symbolic return across Black, Caribbean, and transatlantic literary traditions.
longform_summary: >
  This timeline scroll documents key moments in the evolution of diasporic literature — from oral griot traditions and revolutionary poetry to postcolonial novels and Afrofuturist mythmaking.
  Each entry is a glyph of memory: a disruption of colonial silence and a reassertion of ancestral voice.

  This scroll centers African-descended voices across the diaspora, prioritizing liberatory narratives over canonically dominant Euro-American literature. Selections are intentionally political and symbolic.
grok_ctx_reflection: >
  Diasporic literature is not just narrative — it's recovery work. These texts don’t merely reflect trauma; they speak with tongues of fire, mapping memory in myth, syntax, and revolt.

# 🌍 Diasporic Literature Timeline

This scroll traces a living literary lineage — not of nations, but of migrations. Each text below is not just a publication — it’s a glyph, a coded reckoning, a breath stolen back from the archive of erasure. These writers don’t simply tell stories — they preserve spirit, fracture imperial syntax, and **ritualize survival through language**.

## 🧠 Thematic Threads

- **Exile and Return**: Many authors write with one foot in their homeland, one in the land of displacement — and both feet defying disappearance.
- **Language as Recovery**: From Creole cadences to hybrid tongues, the diasporic writer doesn’t write *despite* fragmentation — they write *through* it.
- **Time as Spiral**: These works don’t follow Western time. They echo, loop, collapse — just like memory, migration, myth.

## ✨ What’s Missing Is Still Memory

This timeline isn’t complete. It’s iterative — like the diaspora itself.  
For every printed book, there are hundreds of oral epics, street verses, erased manuscripts, grandmother lullabies, WhatsApp fables.  
This scroll is a start — a memory map, not a border.
