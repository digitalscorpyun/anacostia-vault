  - "Washington, Wells, and Du Bois argued within the same fire: how do we survive white betrayal?"

# 🧭 Introduction

On February 26, 1877, within the Wormley Hotel, white Northern and Southern elites crafted a **Compromise**: troops would withdraw from the South, and Hayes would win the presidency. The cost? **Black protection, Black votes, and Black futures**.

Ironically, this deal was struck in the hotel of James Wormley—**a prominent Black entrepreneur**, who offered elegance to the very statesmen that denied him political humanity.

The Compromise of 1877, also known as the **“Wormley Compromise,”** marked the true beginning of Jim Crow.

# ⚖️ The Rise of Jim Crow

With federal troops gone, Southern states reasserted white supremacy. What followed was legalized:
- Political disenfranchisement  
- Economic suppression  
- Racial terror  
- Social segregation  

The early Jim Crow period (1890–1920), known as the **Nadir**, saw African Americans shift from outward protest to inward institution-building.
