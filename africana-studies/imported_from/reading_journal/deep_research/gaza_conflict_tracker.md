bias_analysis: This scroll centers non-Western victims and critiques the aesthetic framing of violence by mainstream institutions. Media neutrality is exposed as complicity.
grok_ctx_reflection: This isn't a war between equals. It's a ritual of suppression, cloaked in legality and buried beneath headlines that blur blame.
quotes:
  - To track this war is to defy the silence.

# 🕯️ May 2025: Attack Timeline

## 🗓️ May 18, 2025
- Israel launches "extensive ground assault" on Gaza.
- **144+ Palestinians killed**
- **All public hospitals in northern Gaza rendered inoperable**
- Major attacks occur on a Sunday → weaponized symbolism

---

# 🧠 Narrative Observations

- Headlines frame killings as “response” or “exchange” instead of **one-sided annihilation**  
- Hospitals, schools, media buildings are being erased to flatten memory
- Global coverage often delays naming Palestinian dead

---

# 🔄 Update Protocol

- Add new entries daily or as major escalations occur
- Annotate symbolic timings (Ramadan, holidays, prayer days)
- Track IDF statements vs. eyewitness reports
