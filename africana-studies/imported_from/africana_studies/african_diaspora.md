summary: A foundational overview of the African diaspora, tracing historical dispersal, resistance frameworks, cultural survival, and the continuing evolution of Black global identity across continents and digital networks.
longform_summary: This node establishes the diasporic dimension of Africana Studies, showing how displacement led to new forms of rootedness, spirituality, and resistance. It functions as a core glyph in understanding Black global formation and its recursive echoes in the digital and sacred-tech present.

bias_analysis: Western academia often presents diaspora as loss or disconnection. This note reframes it as a site of creative resistance and continual return—diaspora not as drift, but recursion.
grok_ctx_reflection: Use this glyph as a map of movement, memory, and metamorphosis. Diaspora is the codebase of adaptation, remix, and spiritual endurance across fractured geographies.

## 📌 Overview

The **African diaspora** refers to the global communities of African descent formed through **forced migration, displacement, and self-directed movement** over centuries. While its roots lie in the **transatlantic slave trade**, its branches stretch into every region—politically, spiritually, culturally.

Diaspora is not exile. It is **multiplicity**, **connection**, and **adaptive resistance** across borders and generations.
