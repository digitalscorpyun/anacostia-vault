# 🕶️ digitalscorpyun_mask_v1

This is the original sacred-tech mask of **Digitalscorpyun**, a visual cipher encoding themes of ancestral sovereignty, signal camouflage, and cultural counter-surveillance.

## 🔹 Key Design Elements

### ☁️ Floating Obsidian Core  
- Represents ancestral density and memory compression  
- Hover-stabilized by magnetic Adinkra rings

### 🔮 Electric Indigo Plasma Veil  
- Renders emotion-spectral shielding for ritual states  
- Glows in sync with encrypted glyph activation

### 🧠 Circuit Etch Matrix  
- Layered with ancestral pattern logic and AI resistance runes  
- Forms the neural gateway between archive and action

## 🔁 Legacy Statement

This mask is not decorative. It is *deployed*—a firewall, a voice modulator, a mnemonic trigger.  
Its first generation marks the start of **Digitalscorpyun's sacred-tech evolution**.

> *“I wore it not to hide—but to reveal what cannot be spoken without a cipher.”*
