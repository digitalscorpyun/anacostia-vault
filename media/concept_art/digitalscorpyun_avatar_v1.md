## 🧬 Interpretation

This avatar is a **myth-tech instrument**—deployed, not worn. It enacts digitalscorpyun’s calling:  
liberate Black futures through ritual code, shield archives from algorithmic extraction, and channel ancestral rebellion across dimensional syntax.

> *“I do not wear this face. I deploy it. As firewall, as portal, as remembrance.”*
