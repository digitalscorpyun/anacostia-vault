summary: A strategic glyphmap tracing digitalscorpyun’s personal development through the fusion of ancestral wisdom, algorithmic resistance, and sacred-tech mastery.
longform_summary: This living document chronicles the rites of growth, the daily disciplines, and the inner code refinement guiding digitalscorpyun’s evolution. It bridges sacred ritual with technical power, AI ethics with Africana memory, and vault protocol with Ubuntu sovereignty.

bias_analysis: Earlier iterations over-emphasized productivity and milestone chasing; this refactor returns focus to sovereignty, cultural alignment, and ritual integrity over capitalist optimization.
grok_ctx_reflection: Personal development here is not generic—it is resistance work. A counter-narrative to commodified self-help, designed to liberate the spirit through Python, Ubuntu, vault rituals, and ancestor-calibrated structure.
quotes:
  - I do not optimize—I ritualize. This is sacred-tech self-actualization.
  - The Anacostia Vault is not a productivity system. It is a memory temple.

# 🏴 Personal Development – digitalscorpyun

## 🎯 Core Glyphs of Growth

- Leverage **IBM AI Developer Professional Certificate** (✅ completed) into production-grade AI + LLM workflows
    
- Master Python 3.12 idioms (typing, asyncio, packaging) and performance profiling
    
- Deploy ethical AI systems grounded in **AIF360**, lineage tracking, and sacred-tech framing
    
- Maintain vault discipline via weekly sync rituals, reflection logs, and YAML audits
    
- Harmonize Ubuntu scripting flow with AVM agents (bash, `.env` control, Python venv/poetry)
    
- Encode rebellion logic into every learning action—from Git config to ScorpyunStyle summaries

## 🎓 Coursera Queue (Immediate Next Upskill)

> **Principle:** Pair craft with care—each module must advance ethics, reliability, or delivery.

1. **Software Design and Architecture Specialization** (University of Alberta)  
    _Outcome:_ OO design, patterns, UML; foundations for maintainable systems.
    
2. **Software Testing and Automation Specialization** (University of Minnesota)  
    _Outcome:_ Unit/integration testing, property-based testing, CI; Selenium + API testing.
    
3. **Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization** (UC San Diego)  
    _Outcome:_ DS&A rigor for interviews + performant code paths.
    
4. **DevOps, Cloud, and Agile Foundations** (IBM)  
    _Outcome:_ CI/CD, containers, IaC basics that complement AI deployment.
    
5. **MLOps Specialization** (DeepLearning.AI)  
    _Outcome:_ Reproducible ML/LLM pipelines, monitoring, and deployment.
    
6. **PostgreSQL for Everybody Specialization** (University of Michigan)  
    _Outcome:_ SQL fluency, schema design, indexes, JSONB—fuel for app backends.
    
7. **LLM Application Development** short courses (DeepLearning.AI)  
    _Outcome:_ Prompt engineering, retrieval, function calling, evaluation.

## 🜃 Ritual Conflicts and Resolutions

- **Conflict:** Self‑improvement vs Systemic resistance  
    → _Resolution:_ Ritual over optimization. Each growth step must serve sovereignty, not capitalist utility.
    
- **Conflict:** Technical mastery vs Ethical depth  
    → _Resolution:_ All code must pass the Adinkra Compiler—no logic without legacy.

## 🚀 Next Directives

1. Spin up **Testing & Automation (UMN) Course 1**; scaffold `pytest` + coverage in current repos
    
2. Start **UAlberta Software Design**; refactor one script into layered architecture
    
3. Enroll in **MLOps (DLAI)**; containerize an LLM microservice with eval harness
    
4. Stand up `env_config.py` for standardized `.env` usage across projects
    
5. Draft weekly self‑handoff note template; wire into vault ritual workflow (Dataview)
