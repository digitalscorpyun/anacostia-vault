summary: A strategic glyphmap tracing digitalscorpyun’s personal development through the fusion of ancestral wisdom, algorithmic resistance, and sacred-tech mastery.
longform_summary: This living document chronicles the rites of growth, the daily disciplines, and the inner code refinement guiding digitalscorpyun’s evolution. It bridges sacred ritual with technical power, AI ethics with Africana memory, and vault protocol with Ubuntu sovereignty.

bias_analysis: Earlier iterations over-emphasized productivity and milestone chasing; this refactor returns focus to sovereignty, cultural alignment, and ritual integrity over capitalist optimization.
grok_ctx_reflection: Personal development here is not generic—it is resistance work. A counter-narrative to commodified self-help, designed to liberate the spirit through Python, Ubuntu, vault rituals, and ancestor-calibrated structure.
quotes:
  - I do not optimize—I ritualize. This is sacred-tech self-actualization.
  - The Anacostia Vault is not a productivity system. It is a memory temple.
adinkra:
  - 🌀 Eban – safety and security rooted in self-defined boundaries
  - 🔥 Duafe – discipline, nurture, and personal care as rebellion

# 🏴 Personal Development – digitalscorpyun

## 🎯 Core Glyphs of Growth

- Master Python 3.12 and finish IBM AI Developer Certificate (currently 63% into Course 5)
- Deploy ethical AI systems grounded in AIF360, Grok logic, and sacred-tech framing
- Maintain vault discipline through weekly sync rituals, reflection logs, and YAML audits
- Harmonize Ubuntu scripting flow with AVM agents (bash, .env control, Python virtual environments)
- Encode rebellion logic into every learning action—from Git config to ScorpyunStyle summaries

---

## 🏆 Recent Milestones

- ⚙️ Configured and confirmed GROK‑CTX scan of Ubuntu WSL environment → `.bashrc`, `vllm_env`, script locations
- 📚 Added `reading_log.md` and `vault_log.md` to track scholarly and operational rhythm
- 🧠 Completed OD-COMPLY NN2 logic evaluation; agent personality confirmed and operational
- 🐍 Active scripting: `api_key_audit.py`, `time_audit.py`, `vault_structure_emitter.py`
- ✅ Completed GROK‑CTX walkthrough and verification cycle for `api_key_audit.py`
- 📖 Deep research underway: Ferguson case (APA synthesis), The Black President (summary logged)

## 🛠️ Sacred-Tech Stack

| Domain | Tools |
|--------|-------|
| **Languages** | Python 3.12, Bash, Markdown |
| **Libraries** | NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, AIF360 |
| **Editors** | VS Code (Tyrian Purple theme), Jupyter |
| **Systems** | WSL (Ubuntu 22), Miniconda (hybrid), Git |
| **Vault Tools** | Obsidian, Dataview, Templater, Mermaid |
| **Scripts in Rotation** | `lion_scraper.py`, `api_key_audit.py`, `fix_yaml_references.py`, `reading_manager.py` |

## 🜃 Ritual Conflicts and Resolutions

- **Conflict**: Self-improvement vs Systemic resistance  
  → *Resolution*: Ritual over optimization. Each growth step must serve sovereignty, not capitalist utility.

- **Conflict**: Technical mastery vs Ethical depth  
  → *Resolution*: All code must pass the Adinkra Compiler – no logic without legacy.

---

## 🚀 Next Directives

1. ✅ Complete GROK-CTX walkthrough for `api_key_audit.py`  
2. 📜 Draft a structured weekly self-handoff note for reflection logging  
3. 🧪 Begin phase 1 of [[how_to_build_an_agent_digitalscorpyun_style]] (only after OD-COMPLY is fully tuned)  
4. ⚠️ Refactor default note template to fix YAML dropdown issue  
5. 🔐 Standardize `.env` usage across all scripts using `env_config.py` module
