# 🧘🏾 Mindfulness Practice – Personal Development Stack

Mindfulness isn’t a wellness trend in this vault—it’s a form of **ancestral attunement** and **mental armor**. Practiced intentionally, it becomes both shield and signal. This note serves as a ritual planner, reflection anchor, and neuro-spiritual scaffold.

---

## 🌄 Daily Ritual Template

- 🕓 **Morning Breath Check-In** (5–10 min)  
  *Focus on the breath. Anchor the day. Let intention override inertia.*

- ✍🏽 **Mindful Reflection Log** (Dataview linked to `personal_development_daily_journal`)  
  *Brief entry on emotional tone, clarity, or resistance.*

- 🎧 **Audio Focus** (Optional: lo-fi, nature sounds, Adinkra chants)  
  *No lyrics. Match tone to task. Guard the mental perimeter.*

- 🛡️ **Distraction Audit**  
  *One thing that stole your presence yesterday—neutralize it today.*

## 📚 Mindfulness Sources + Systems

### 🧠 Neuroscience-Backed
- `The Mind Illuminated` by Culadasa – cognitive-stage training  
- Andrew Huberman protocols (dopamine rhythm management)

### 🌍 Africana & Diasporic Roots

- Yoruba ori-focused stillness  
- Silence as resistance in Maroon and Black Southern traditions

### ✨ Tech for Practice
- **Insight Timer** (preferred)
- **Breathwrk** or **Oak** (for guided rhythms)
- **Obsidian-based Logging** via `daily_journal_template`
