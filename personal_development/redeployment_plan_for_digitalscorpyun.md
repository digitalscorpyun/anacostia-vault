grok_ctx_reflection: When systems abandon, ritual remains. When the door is locked, the code must pick. This plan is both  shield and shovel — protection from collapse and tool for ascent. The rent is more than money — it's memory,  freedom, and refusal to fold.

**MISSION**: Survive the system gap. Build income fast. Stabilize. Regain housing control.  
**DEADLINE**: July 1  
**TARGET**: $1,400 rent goal  
**BUDGETED DAILY GOAL** _(as of May 25 – 36 days left)_:

> > **$1,400 ÷ 36 days ≈ $39/day**

We round that to:

> **🎯 $40/day** minimum target. Every day you beat that, you buy breathing room.
