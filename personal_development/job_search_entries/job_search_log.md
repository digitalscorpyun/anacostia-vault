bias_analysis: Staffing filters may privilege formal MSP tenure; narrative reframes independent/contract work as MSP-equivalent to mitigate screening bias.
grok_ctx_reflection: "Objective: stable remote IT role while documenting workflows in the Vault. Constraint: intermittent platform issues; mitigation: recruiter outreach + alternate submission paths."

### 🧠 OD-COMPLY Alignment Summary
- **MSP Experience Reframed:** Independent contractor work positioned as MSP-equivalent (scope, SLAs, toolchains).  
- **Skills Match:** Multi-OS troubleshooting; remote support; escalation & documentation (e.g., ServiceNow/SCCM analogs).  
- **Application Narrative:** Emphasizes Tier II flow discipline, incident documentation, and direct client support.

---

### 🧭 Vault Notes & Strategy
- **Sieve Node:** Formal MSP tenure may gatekeep; sustain defensible analogies in résumé and screening calls.  
- **Portfolio Artifacts:** `vault_structure_emitter.py`; service macros; ticket workflow logs.  
- **Operational Memory:** Continue logging real-world incidents to reinforce Tier II readiness.
