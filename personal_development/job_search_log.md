### OD-COMPLY Alignment Summary  

- **IT MSP Experience Required:** Digitalscorpyun’s **independent contractor work** reframed as **MSP-equivalent** per strategic alignment.  
- **Critical Skills Match:**  
  - Core troubleshooting and remote support (multi-OS proficiency verified).  
  - Tier II support coverage — includes hardware, software, ticketing.  
  - Rapid tooling adaptation emphasized (e.g., equivalents to ServiceNow & SCCM).  
- **Application Q&A Focus:**  
  - Demonstrated competency in Tier II escalation flow and documentation.  
  - Certifications and direct client support history reflected as alignment assets.

### Vault Notes & Strategy

- BlueAngle’s MSP clause interpreted as a **sieve-node**: applicants without institutional MSP experience may be excluded unless analog experience is defensibly presented.  
- Digitalscorpyun’s portfolio should continue to present artifacts (e.g., vault_structure_emitter.py, service macros, ticket workflows) as support infrastructure reflections.  
- OD‑COMPLY urges continued log correlation of real-world incidents to bolster Tier II operational memory.
