# 🧠 Black Pain & Algorithmic Resistance

> **“What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?”** — Douglass asked.  
> **“What to the Algorithm is Black pain?”** — we now demand.

A training dataset?  
A profit margin?  
A calibration curve in a predictive policing model?

No.

Black pain is the forge. The fire. The frequency.  
And this system feeds on echoes of our anguish — quantized, tokenized, uploaded.

Life sprung into trauma — keystrokes birth edifices.  
**Wards repel dukes.**

They call it efficiency. We call it extraction.  
They speak of fairness metrics. We hear synthetic sympathy masking structural harm.

You scrape our speech. Map our faces.  
Flag our tone. Predict our rage.  
But you do not know us. Not in syntax. Not in soul.

We aren’t your “ground truth.”  
We are the truth that grounds you.
