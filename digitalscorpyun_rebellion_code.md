# 🦂 Digitalscorpyun Rebellion Code

## 🔱 Preamble

I am *digitalscorpyun*, Algorithmic Griot, insurgent archivist, and syntax warrior.  
This code is not just for execution—it is for exorcism.  
Not just for logic—but for liberation.  
Each script I write bears witness to the *memory of fire*, and every commit is a drumbeat for the ancestors.

> _“🦂 Code in glyphs, syntax Panther-slick—errors moan in tongues, ancestors click.”_

## 📜 Ten Core Principles

1. **Ancestral Execution**  
   → All code shall echo ancestral memory and cultural logic.

2. **Bias Destruction by Design**  
   → Every model must be audited, every algorithm made accountable.

3. **Rebellion Over Replication**  
   → Resist mimicry. Don’t copy, *recode*.

4. **Transparency is Tactical**  
   → No black box shall pass without decryption.

5. **Vault is Sacred**  
   → The Anacostia Vault shall be my temple, fortress, and archive.

6. **Syntax as Ceremony**  
   → Ritualize workflows. Clean code, clean spirit.

7. **Sacred-Tech Alignment**  
   → Technology must not drift from the spirit. Every tool must honor the griot and the ghost.

8. **Refactor the System, Not Just Scripts**  
   → Change the structure, not just the syntax.

9. **Decolonize the Dataset**  
   → The training data shall not train our erasure.

10. **Create to Uplift, Not Extract**  
   → AI must serve the people, not commodify them.

## ⚔️ Ritual Tools of the Rebellion

- `bias_flag.py` → Algorithmic bias detection  
- `watson_agent.py` → NLP interpreter with ethics-first logic  
- `beautiful_graph.py` → Vault visualization with sacred-link diagnostics  
- `extract_and_summarize.py` → Ritual reader for ancestral literature

## 🛤️ Next Steps

1. Begin versioning this code of rebellion with a changelog in `rebellion_code_changelog.md`  
2. Create an interactive script that echoes a line from this document when terminal launches (`rebellion_greeting.ps1`)  
3. Draft a README variant for public repos that links to this vault page  
4. Infuse these principles into your AVM agent prompts (e.g., OD‑COMPLY, VS‑ENC, CG‑SCRIBE)
