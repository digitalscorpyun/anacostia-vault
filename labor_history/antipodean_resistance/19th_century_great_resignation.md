summary: "A comparative historical analysis of 19th-century labor walkouts in the Antipodes and their resonance with the 21st-century Great Resignation."
longform_summary: "This note excavates labor withdrawal patterns from 19th-century Australia and Aotearoa—goldfield desertions, convict walk-offs, and whaler strikes—and maps their echoes in contemporary resignations, gig economy shifts, and digital escape mechanisms. Emphasizes frontier trauma, labor autonomy, and ScorpyunStyle historiography."

bias_analysis: "Modern frameworks may romanticize digital labor freedom without accounting for the coerced nature of historical resignation events. Colonial archives often silence Indigenous and gendered perspectives."
grok_ctx_reflection: "This labor resistance lineage reveals data-age parallels. From fleeing shepherds to freelancing coders, refusal becomes ritual—when labor sees itself not as a commodity, but as memory-bearing force."
quotes:
  - "What the digital nomad chooses, the convict shepherd took."
  - "Capital’s fragility is revealed when labor remembers its power."
  - "Frontiers and platforms both promise escape—and enforce discipline."
