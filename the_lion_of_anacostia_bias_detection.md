# 🦁 The Lion of Anacostia – Bias Detection in AI

> _"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will."_ — Frederick Douglass  
> _"He leads the humble in justice, and He teaches the humble His way."_ — Psalms 25:9 (AMP)

This initiative is the tactical core of **The Lion of Anacostia**—your flagship project to interrogate AI systems with sacred-tech discipline and archive-driven justice. It synthesizes **Africana epistemology**, **Python scripting**, and the **IBM AIF360 Toolkit** to identify, analyze, and mitigate algorithmic bias in the wild.

## 🎯 Mission Focus

- Detect patterns of racial, gendered, or class-based discrimination in ML workflows.
    
- Equip community leaders and technologists with tools to **audit**, **report**, and **redress** algorithmic harms.
    
- Reclaim the narrative: bias detection isn’t just math—it’s **resistance** coded in logic.

## 🧠 Technical Framework

### 🧩 Bias Detection Levels

1. **Statistical Bias**
    
    - Dataset imbalance (e.g., underrepresentation of marginalized groups)
        
    - Skewed labeling or sampling errors
        
2. **Systemic Bias**
    
    - Architecture/design decisions that privilege specific outcomes
        
    - Algorithmic feedback loops in recommendation or predictive systems
        
3. **Societal Harm**
    
    - Disproportionate impacts on housing, criminal justice, healthcare, and employment

## 🛠 Key Tools & Methods

### 🔹 IBM AI Fairness 360 Toolkit

- **Metrics**: Statistical Parity Difference, Disparate Impact Ratio, Equal Opportunity Difference
    
- **Python Integration**: Compatible with pandas, scikit-learn
    
- **Data Structures**: `BinaryLabelDataset`, `ClassificationMetric`, etc.
    
- [[ai-ml-bias-detection-tools.md]]
    

### 🔹 Python-Based Audits (tool-agnostic pseudocode)

```python
from aif360.datasets import BinaryLabelDataset
from aif360.metrics import ClassificationMetric

# Load dataset
data = BinaryLabelDataset(...)

# Compute bias metric
metric = ClassificationMetric(data, data, unprivileged_groups, privileged_groups)
print("Statistical Parity Difference:", metric.statistical_parity_difference())
```

### 🔹 Cross-Referencing Metrics

- Use `DIR`, `TPR parity`, `Predictive Equality` to validate fairness from multiple angles

## 📖 GriotBox Examples

- _Redlining by Code_: Predictive policing systems flag Black neighborhoods at 3x the rate.
    
- _Hiring Gatekeepers_: Resume filtering AIs downrank applicants with historically Black names.
    

---

## 🔮 Looking Ahead

- ✅ Establish automated weekly audits of scraped datasets
    
- ✅ Map audit results to policy/activism templates
    
- 🔲 Integrate visuals of disparities for media impact (via matplotlib, seaborn)
    
- 🔲 Design a Sankofa-themed dashboard for real-time metric monitoring

## 🏁 Closing Thought

> _"Code is never neutral. Every loop, every condition, every outcome speaks a politics. So speak yours, clearly."_ — ScorpyunStyle

The lion roars not to echo pain—but to warn injustice it is being watched. Let the audit begin.
