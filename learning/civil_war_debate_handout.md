# Civil War Debate Handout: It **Was** About Slavery

## Thesis

Secession—and the war it triggered—centered on **slavery’s preservation and expansion**. The leaders said so, the seceding states wrote so, and the Confederate constitution codified it.

## Primary “Receipts” (short, citable quotes)

### 1) What Confederate leaders said

- **Alexander H. Stephens, CSA VP (“Cornerstone Speech,” Mar 21, 1861):**  
    “**This was the immediate cause** of the late rupture… Our new government… rests upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that **slavery**… is his natural and normal condition.”
    

### 2) Why states said they left (their own declarations)

- **Mississippi (Jan 9, 1861):**  
    “**Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery**—the greatest material interest of the world.”
    
- **South Carolina (Dec 24, 1860):**  
    Protests the North’s “**increasing hostility to the institution of slavery**,” especially refusal to return fugitives.
    
- **Georgia (Jan 29, 1861):**  
    Condemns the North for seeking “the **exclusion of slavery from the Territories**” and for aiding fugitives.
    
- **Texas (Feb 2, 1861):**  
    Praises slavery as “**mutually beneficial**,” denounces non-slaveholding states for hostility to it.
    

### 3) What the Confederate Constitution protected (Mar 1861)

- Explicit recognition of **“the right of property in negro slaves.”**
    
- Required **fugitive return** between states.
    
- Forbade any Confederate law that would **impair slavery** in the territories.

## Rapid Rebuttals to Common Myths

### “It was about states’ rights.”

**Which right?** The documents specify **the right to own people** and to have that right enforced (fugitive returns, expansion into territories). Southern leaders opposed Northern **states’ rights** when free states passed personal-liberty laws.

### “It was tariffs/economics.”

- **Secession began before** the Morrill Tariff became law.
    
- The CSA quickly adopted its **own tariffs**.
    
- Their **own secession texts** don’t cite tariffs as core grievances; they cite **slavery**.
    

### “Lincoln didn’t start as an abolitionist, so it wasn’t about slavery.”

- Lincoln ran on **halting slavery’s expansion**. Secessionists cited that as intolerable.
    
- War began when **seceded states fired on Fort Sumter**; their reason for seceding was slavery.
    
- Emancipation became policy in 1862–63, but **the cause of secession** was already plainly slavery.
    

### “Most soldiers didn’t own slaves.”

True for many enlisted men—but **governments set war aims**. The **cause of secession** (the Confederacy’s reason to exist) was slavery’s protection.

When people say “states’ rights,” ask **“the right to do what?”** Their own words answer: **to maintain, expand, and federally enforce chattel slavery.**
