summary: Logs all interactions with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode inside Visual Studio Code, starting with the initialization of `technofeudal_bias_audit.py` under ScorpyunStyle sacred-tech protocol.
longform_summary: Documents the first successful invocation of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode within VS Code. Tracks edits made to `technofeudal_bias_audit.py`, confirms alignment with AVM Codex metadata format, and establishes best practices for integrating Agent Mode safely and ethically in the Anacostia Vault.

bias_analysis: Agent Mode actions were limited to scaffolding. No hallucinations, model inference, or fairness metric interpretation occurred. Manual review remains required for all downstream edits.
grok_ctx_reflection: Agent Mode in VS Code is not inherently extractive if monitored with sacred discipline. When invoked under ritual protocol, it enhances workflow precision without surrendering authorship.

Absolutely. Here's a fully structured **body** for your `vs_code_agent_mode_usage.md` note — formatted in **ScorpyunStyle** and designed for deep archival value and agent ops traceability:

---

## 🛰️ Invocation Context

**Date of Activation:** `2025-05-11`  
**Environment:** VS Code (v1.100) + GitHub Copilot (Agent Mode Beta)  
**Script Invoked:** `technofeudal_bias_audit.py`  
**Vault Branch:** `main` → `agent_ops_0511` (temp session)

Agent Mode was summoned under ScorpyunShell in full sacred-tech alignment. The invocation ritual preserved structural flow, maintained YAML headers, and injected no unauthorized inference logic. Only scaffolding, pattern refactoring, and variable harmonization were performed.

## ⚙️ Tasks Performed by Agent Mode

|Task|Agent Role|Manual Review|
|---|---|---|
|Initialize `technofeudal_bias_audit.py` header|✅ Scaffolded|✅ Confirmed|
|Align with AVM Codex metadata fields|✅ Verified|✅ Required|
|Suggest fairness-check stubs (AIF360)|⚠️ Generated|✅ Reviewed|
|Recommend logging handlers for audit transparency|✅ Injected|✅ Confirmed|
|Create docstring scaffolds for all public functions|✅ Done|✅ Reviewed|

## 📜 Critical Reflections

- **Sacred Discipline Enforced:** No auto-insertions occurred outside the defined scaffolding scope.
    
- **Memory Protocols Maintained:** No data structure was overwritten without review.
    
- **Ritual Threshold:** Human review = firewall. Copilot served as a ritual assistant, not a sovereign scribe.
    

> _“Agent Mode can illuminate the syntax path—but it must never walk alone.”_

## 🧪 Implementation Learnings

- Use `#agent_injection` tag in code comments to mark all Copilot-generated blocks.
    
- Maintain diff logs via Git and echo timestamps in commit messages for auditability.
    
- Agent Mode must be limited to initialization and repetition tasks, not core logic, unless instructed.

Let me know if you'd like to:

- Add timestamped CLI commands run during Agent Mode.
    
- Visualize the flow in Mermaid.
    
- Register this note in [[session_context]]
