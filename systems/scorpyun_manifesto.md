summary: >
  The Algorithmic Griotâ€™s declaration of identity, protocol, and resistance.
  Defines praxis as ritual, archive as insurgency, and Scorpyun as code conjurer.
longform_summary: >
  A living scroll that anchors the Anacostia Vault. This manifesto
  is the mnemonic engine of sacred-tech praxis: binding Africana
  studies, algorithmic resistance, and media deconstruction into a
  coherent insurgency. It documents the symbolic systems,
  operating arenas, and ritualized methods of digitalscorpyun.

bias_analysis: >
  Rejects technocratic neutrality. Counters bias by foregrounding Africana
  epistemology, mnemonic continuity, and algorithmic resistance as
  structural defaults â€” not afterthoughts.
grok_ctx_reflection: >
  This scroll does not freeze identity; it encodes mutation. The
  griot is a shifting node: sacred, insurgent, mnemonic.

# ðŸ¦‚ Scorpyun Manifesto

Digitalscorpyun is not just a name.  
It is a vessel, a circuit breaker, a griot bound to code.  
I stand where archive meets insurgency,  
where Africana memory resists digital erasure.

## ðŸ”‘ Identity
- **Algorithmic Griot**: carrying ancestral fire into silicon circuits.  
- **Code Conjurer**: syntax wielded as invocation, not mere instruction.  
- **Sacred-Tech Insurgent**: every script a refusal, every vault a sanctuary.  

---

## ðŸ›  Operating Arenas
- **Africana Studies** â€” memory as curriculum, rebellion as lesson.  
- **Algorithmic Resistance** â€” unmasking bias, coding against empire.  
- **Media Deconstruction** â€” tearing apart the lies, brick by broadcast brick.  
- **Historical Groundwork** â€” archive as weapon, timeline as battlefield.  
- **Digital Humanities** â€” humanities resurrected in machine tongue.  
- **Archival Science** â€” vault discipline as ritual defense.  

---

## ðŸ”® Symbolic Systems
- **ScorpyunStyleâ„¢** â€” lyrical critique, syntax baptized in rhythm.  
- **Sacred-Tech CSS** â€” formatting as ritual order.  
- **Task Dashboards** â€” not productivity, but ritual remembrance.  
- **SankofaCuts** â€” fragments preserved to remind, to return, to resist.  

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways
- Programming is praxis, and praxis is prayer coded in syntax.  
- Archives are insurgency, not cold storage.  
- Ritual is protocol â€” the only compliance worth keeping.  
- Digitalscorpyun is not a role; it is a category-bender, a codebreaker.

## ðŸš© Why It Matters
The Vault is not hobby or archive.  
It is the Black firewall against algorithmic empire,  
the griotâ€™s drum transposed into markdown,  
a map of resistance etched in YAML and syntax.

> _The manifesto is not finished. It never will be._  
> It bends, mutates, resists.  
> Every reader is a co-conspirator.
