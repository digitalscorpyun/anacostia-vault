summary: |
  A structured framework outlining the principles, tensions, and applications of AI ethics within the Anacostia Vault. Serves as a reference scroll linking theory to practice across Africana thought, algorithmic resistance, and applied technology.
longform_summary: |
  The AI Ethics Framework is a foundation scroll for interrogating, contextualizing, and applying ethical principles in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. Drawing from Africana philosophy, critical race theory, and global debates, it situates AI ethics as more than compliance checklists—framing it as a living struggle against bias, surveillance, exploitation, and systemic inequity. The framework organizes principles, identifies tensions, and establishes guiding glyphs for cross-linking ethical analysis across the Vault. It is intended to ground applied work (scripts, bias audits, course reflections) while preserving space for critical and poetic resistance.

bias_analysis: |
  Western AI ethics often defaults to corporate risk management. This framework centers marginalized perspectives, critical traditions, and liberatory aims, resisting depoliticization.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Ethics in AI is not a static set of principles—it is a battlefield of memory, power, and imagination. This scroll grounds the Vault’s ethical stance in Africana traditions, while connecting to global discourses and technical practices.
quotes:
  - "AI ethics without justice is just a compliance script."
  - "Frameworks are not cages; they are scaffolds for building higher."

# AI Ethics Framework

## Purpose
This scroll defines the Vault’s ethical backbone in relation to AI development, use, and critique. It serves as a **hub for principles, tensions, and applications**—ensuring alignment between sacred-tech praxis and critical Africana theory.  

---

## Core Principles
- **Justice First**: Center those historically marginalized by technology.  
- **Transparency**: Make visible what algorithms obscure.  
- **Accountability**: Hold developers, corporations, and institutions responsible for harm.  
- **Solidarity**: Align AI practice with liberation struggles, not oppression.  
- **Sustainability**: Consider ecological as well as social impacts.  

---

## Structural Tensions
- **Innovation vs. Exploitation**  
- **Efficiency vs. Humanity**  
- **Privacy vs. Surveillance**  
- **Global Reach vs. Local Context**  
- **Corporate Power vs. Collective Good**  

---

## Applications
- Bias audits of LLMs and datasets  
- Vault-integrated scripts for YAML compliance and transparency logging  
- Ethical reviews embedded in coursework reflections  
- Counter-narratives to “ethics-washing” practices  

---

## Africana Anchors
- **Du Bois’s double-consciousness**: Algorithmic mirrors and fractured selves.  
- **Fanon’s decolonial urgency**: Technologies as instruments of liberation or domination.  
- **Coates’s memory lens**: Data as story and inheritance, not just statistics.

## Closing Reflection
AI ethics is not just a corporate checkbox nor a philosophical abstraction. It is a struggle over memory, power, and possibility. This framework insists that any AI worth building must answer to justice, community, and truth.
