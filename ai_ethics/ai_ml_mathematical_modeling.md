summary: Structured exploration of the core mathematical foundations powering AI/ML systems, with focus on fairness, bias detection, and optimization techniques.
longform_summary: This scroll dissects the mathematical DNA of AI/ML — from linear algebra to differential equations — mapping their roles in model training, bias quantification, and algorithmic fairness. It anchors each mathematical layer to ethical application and sacred-tech practice in the Anacostia Vault.

bias_analysis: Leverages quantitative techniques to analyze systemic distortion, while challenging dominant metrics that assume neutrality in math. Focuses on how even numbers can lie under unjust assumptions.
grok_ctx_reflection: "Mathematical modeling in this vault is not neutral abstraction — it is a ritual of calibration. Every equation becomes a site of power: to affirm or to dismantle."
quotes:
  - "The algorithm is only as just as the math beneath it."

## 🔍 Core Concepts

| Field              | Key Ideas                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Algebra**     | Vectors, matrices, eigenvalues, decomposition — forms the base of neural nets.       |
| **Calculus**           | Derivatives, chain rule, integrals — powers gradient descent and model tuning.        |
| **Probability & Statistics** | Bayes, distributions, hypothesis testing — crucial for predictions + fairness metrics. |
| **Optimization**        | Convex optimization, regularization — enables model convergence and robustness.     |
| **Differential Equations** | Models dynamic behavior in RNNs, system prediction, and continuous flows.         |
| **Bias Quantification** | Statistical parity, fairness metrics, disparity analysis using math as protest.     |

## 🧪 Applications in Sacred-Tech Workflows

- **⚖️ Bias Detection:**  
  Model disparity across groups using regression, ANOVA, and fairness measures.

- **📈 Algorithm Optimization:**  
  Apply calculus-driven methods (e.g., stochastic gradient descent) to improve model accuracy and convergence.

- **🧮 Fairness Metrics:**  
  Design metrics like Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity to assess and correct systemic skew.

- **🗣️ NLP + LLMs:**  
  Use matrix ops and statistical models to decode linguistic bias and improve text equity in generative AI.

- **🖼️ Computer Vision:**  
  Leverage convolutional math + PCA for equitable image classification and object recognition.

## 🛠 Ritual Note

Mathematics here is not neutral. It is structured logic, and all structure bears bias or liberation. When applied in the vault, numbers don’t just compute — they confess.

> _“You can’t liberate what you can’t measure. But measure wrong, and you imprison the truth.”_

Would you like me to refactor `bias_flag.md`, `ai-ml-overview.md`, or `the-lion-of-anacostia-bias-detection.md` next?
