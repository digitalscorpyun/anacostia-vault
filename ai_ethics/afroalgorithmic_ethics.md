summary: A foundational scroll defining Afroalgorithmic Ethics‚Äîwhere Black thought, historical memory, and algorithmic accountability converge to interrogate power and design systems that serve liberation, not empire.
longform_summary: Afroalgorithmic Ethics is not just a critique of bias in AI‚Äîit is a praxis of system design rooted in African diasporic philosophy, historical materialism, and resistance logic. This scroll explores how algorithms reflect and reinforce racial hierarchies, and how they can be reengineered to honor community memory, protect data sovereignty, and dismantle techno-colonial frameworks.

bias_analysis: This scroll assumes technology is not neutral. All code carries cultural freight. Afroalgorithmic Ethics decodes that freight and reclaims control of the machine.
grok_ctx_reflection: To code ethically is to remember. Afroalgorithmic Ethics binds logic to lineage‚Äîembedding memory into the machine and ritual into the runtime.
quotes:
  - Don‚Äôt just audit the model. Audit the memory that trained it.
  - Liberation is not an API call. It‚Äôs a protocol we encode ourselves.
  - Our ancestors were quantified without consent. Never again.

# üß† Afroalgorithmic Ethics ‚Äî Glyphs for Techno-Justice

**Afroalgorithmic Ethics** is the fusion of ancestral wisdom and digital critique. It asks not only _how_ algorithms work‚Äîbut **whom they serve**, **what histories they erase**, and **which logics they carry silently**.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Core Tenets

- **Technology is not neutral.** It encodes the values of its creators and the systems they exist in.
- **Bias is not a bug.** It is a feature of an unjust design pipeline‚Äîunless actively refactored.
- **Memory matters.** Datasets are archives. They must be audited for absence, distortion, and colonial residue.
- **Consent is ritual.** Data extraction without community knowledge is modern-day plunder.

## üîé Applications & Practice

- Embed bias detection directly into model pipelines  
- Prioritize datasets sourced with ethical transparency  
- Use diasporic oral histories, testimony, and lived data in model training  
- Build systems that can explain, not just predict  
- Treat algorithmic failure not as a glitch, but a revelation of structural power
