# ScorpyunStyle™ Summary: Intro to Machine Learning for Anacostia Vault

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  
- This note lays the **foundational ML concepts** necessary for your IBM AI Developer journey and decolonial tech mission.  
- Covers **paradigms** (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement), **algorithms** (decision trees, neural nets, SVMs, clustering), and **Python frameworks** (scikit‑learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).  
- Serves as the **technical cornerstone**, linking to `[[ai-ml-overview]]` and `[[python-overview]]`.

## 🌍 Context & Background  
Machine learning empowers systems to learn from data without explicit rules. As you pursue your IBM AI Developer certification, mastering these fundamentals is crucial for pattern detection, prediction, and bias awareness. This intro blends theory with hands‑on Python guidance, ensuring both technical depth and ethical mindfulness.

## 📌 Main Points & Analysis  
- **Core ML Paradigms**  
  - *Supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning*  
  - *Relevance*: They structure your certification curriculum.  
- **Key Algorithms**  
  - *Decision Trees, Neural Networks, SVMs, Clustering*  
  - *Connection*: Underpins your `[[ai-ml-neural-networks]]` and `[[bias-detection]]` work.  
- **Implementation Frameworks**  
  - *scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch*  
  - *Example*: Building bias‑detection pipelines in Python.  
- **Vault Integration**  
  - Bridges theory to practice, anchoring ML concepts in your codebase.

## 🔄 Competing Perspectives  
- **Black‑Box vs. Explainable AI**  
  - Performance vs. interpretability tension.  
  - *Your Stance*: Balance efficiency with transparency to honor ethical AI principles.

## 🚀 Industry & Social Relevance  
- **Impact**: ML shapes decisions across finance, healthcare, and criminal justice.  
- **At Risk**: Marginalized communities bear the brunt of biased systems.  
- **Vision**: Your expertise in both code and ethics positions you to build ML that empowers, not oppresses.
