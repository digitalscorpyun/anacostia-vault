summary: |
  Finalized inventory for digitalscorpyun's first custom PC build, with full Newegg cart breakdown and a licensed Windows 11 Home USB. This rig represents the first physical shrine of Algorithmic Griot codework, built under budget and optimized for dev power.
longform_summary: |
  After decades of providing tech support and hardware troubleshooting for others, this marks the first time digitalscorpyun builds a personal desktop from the ground up. The components were carefully selected for power, compatibility, and future-proofing—all while staying close to a $500–600 budget.

  A Micro-ATX build centered around the AMD Ryzen 5 5600G (integrated Radeon graphics), paired with 32GB DDR4 RAM, a 500GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD, and a Rosewill mini-tower case with a 400W PSU. WiFi and Bluetooth support are provided via a TP-Link PCIe card. Finally, a licensed copy of Windows 11 Home was secured via USB install media, making this rig dual-boot ready alongside Ubuntu if desired.

  This is the launchpad. A Scorpyun’s digital altar. A boot sequence encoded in ancestral flame.
