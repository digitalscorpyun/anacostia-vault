# 📚 Sankofa Reading Journey

This document is the **strategic command post** for graduate-level readings within the Anacostia Vault. Each entry advances ethical AI, Africana study, and sacred-tech fluency using culturally aware protocols—primarily **ScorpyunStyle™**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To extract knowledge with ritual precision—through annotation, critique, and contextual awareness—then store it as structured memory within the vault.

---

## 🧠 Summary Format – ScorpyunStyle™

> Every entry must channel analytical fire, cultural grounding, and vault alignment.

### Required Sections:

1. **Key Takeaways** – Main arguments, revelations, contradictions.  
2. **Historical & Cultural Context** – Origin, lineage, speaker’s position.  
3. **Critical Analysis** – Rhetorical strengths, ideological gaps, bias detection.  
4. **Contemporary Connection** – Link to AI, ethics, justice, or tech culture.  
5. **Relevance to the Vault** – Why it matters to your personal/professional arc.  
6. **Conclusion/Reflection** – Open questions, resonances, action steps.

---

## 🗂️ Structured Metadata (YAML/CSV Compatible)

These fields must accompany each summary for programmatic processing and vault integrity:

- `author`:  
- `title`:  
- `chapter`:  
- `summary`:  
- `key_takeaways`:  
- `critical_analysis`:  
- `contemporary_connection`:  
- `date_read`:  
- `published_date`:  
- `notes_path`:  
- `tags`:  
- `source_type`:  
- `source_url`:  
- `extracted_by`:  

Refer to [[reading_log_schema]] for the canonical JSON schema.

## ⚙️ Agent Instruction Protocol

> “You are a scholarly agent under `digitalscorpyun`, the Algorithmic Griot. Summarize this work in ScorpyunStyle™—clarity-rich, culturally coded, graduate-level. Output should be vault-ready and align with `extract_and_summarize.py` expectations.”

---

## 🔁 Rituals & Ops Discipline

- 🔄 Log all completed reads weekly in `reading_log.csv`  
- 🧠 Review for vault tag coherence (`#scorpyunstyle`, `#reading_journal`, etc.)  
- 💾 Commit backup of summaries to GitHub every 7 days  
- ⛓ Update `ibm_certification.md` when coursework reading intersects  
- 🛰 Assign agents (ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek) according to topic expertise  
- ⚖️ Use JSON format for archival and automation; Markdown for human readability
