## 👑 Nzinga as Anti-Algorithmic Strategist

Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba didn’t just resist colonial power—she **outmaneuvered it**. Her reign was marked by **diplomatic agility**, **tactical adaptability**, and an unwavering defense of her people’s sovereignty.

Today, we face a new form of imperialism:  
**Algorithmic Colonialism.**  
It speaks Python instead of Portuguese.  
It extracts data instead of bodies.  
But its intent—to dominate, categorize, and extract—is hauntingly familiar.

## 🛡️ Applying Nzinga’s Playbook to AI Ethics

Nzinga’s strategies offer a mirror for resisting today’s digital empires:

- **Refusal to Be Defined:** Nzinga rejected imposed categories of identity and power. In AI, this maps to resisting biased classification systems, facial recognition racism, and predictive policing algorithms.
    
- **Territorial Sovereignty:** Nzinga forged new coalitions, moved her capital when under siege, and refused surrender. Digitally, this means building **data sanctuaries**, **sovereign tech**, and **community-led infrastructure** free from Big Tech surveillance.
    
- **Strategic Masquerade:** Nzinga donned multiple roles—warrior, diplomat, tactician. In AI resistance, this means hybrid approaches: policy work, code rewrites, underground organizing, and public disruption.

## 🧠 From Queen to Query: Decolonial AI Design Principles

Nzinga’s legacy suggests that ethical AI should:

- Be **context-aware**, not culturally agnostic.
    
- Prioritize **collective survival** over individual utility.
    
- Respect **knowledge sovereignty**—who creates, who benefits, who is erased.
    
- Refuse the default settings of white-coded objectivity and neoliberal optimization.

## 🕯️ Close: Protocol Ain’t Passive

Nzinga’s resistance wasn’t reactive—it was **active protocol engineering**.

> To fight algorithmic colonizers, we must become **technological tacticians** with ancestral blueprints.

She didn’t just defend Matamba. She redesigned it.

What will you redesign?
