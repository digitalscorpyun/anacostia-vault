  - "Data justice (metrics with memory)"
bias_analysis: |
  Default curricula privilege Eurocentric origin stories and extract Black creativity from its conditions.
  Counter with primary Black voices, maroon archives, and method transparency (who counts, who benefits, who is harmed).
  Treat claims of neutrality as positional; document stance and funding.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Use this as the hub when drafting critiques, sermons, or code rituals. Evidence first, metaphor sharp, stakes explicit.
  When in doubt, write the SankofaCut; when building, consult the Methods Kit.

# Africana Studies — Overview

> _"Africana Studies explores the historical, cultural, political, and economic experiences of people of African descent globally, offering a critical framework to understand Black identity, resistance, and contributions to civilization."_

## ScorpyunStyle

**Key Takeaways**
- Africana Studies is a **systems reader** and a **world-builder**: it decodes empire (law, labor, land, ledgers) and chronicles Black creation under constraint.
- It is **interdisciplinary by necessity**—history, politics, economics, philosophy, art, tech—because oppression is cross-domain and so is liberation.
- Evidence lives in **routes and returns**: Atlantic/Indian Ocean trades, maroons, Pan-African congresses, HBCUs, Black arts, abolition, AI/algorithmic resistance.

**Context**
- Field formalized through **1960s campus insurgencies**; rooted earlier in abolitionist print culture, HBCUs, and Pan-African thought. Global scope: Africa ↔ Caribbean ↔ Americas ↔ Europe ↔ Global South.

**Counterpoints**
- Celebration vs. structure: avoid museum-only views. Pair brilliance with **political economy**.  
- Identity vs. material: track **budgets, deeds, contracts, code** alongside poetry and performance.  
- “Objectivity” claims: cite position, data provenance, and method limits.

**Why It Matters**
- This field supplies the **analytic kit** and **cultural memory** required to design policy, technology, and art that **repair** rather than repeat harm.

*Poetic Close:*  
Archive as altar; syllabus as shield. We remember to rebuild.

## SankofaCut (quick recall)

**Thesis:** Africana Studies is the blueprint for reading power, memory, and Black world-making.  
- Interdisciplinary spine; diaspora method (routes/returns).  
- Measures material stakes: land, labor, law, ledgers.  
**Tension:** Heritage celebration // System analysis  
**So-what:** Use it to decode structures—and to design counter-structures.

## UBW — Lineage Map

**1) Origins (roots & logic)**  
- Abolitionist letters/press; HBCU scholarship; Pan-African congresses; church as classroom/safehouse/command center.  
_Receipts to self:_ San Francisco State strike (1968); Howard/Temple early departments.

**2) Modifications / Moments (inflections)**  
- Pan-Africanism → Black Power → **Black Feminism** (Combahee, intersectionality).  
- Cultural turns: **Harlem Renaissance → Black Arts → Hip-Hop**; **Negritude**; **Afrofuturism**.  
- Method turns: oral history, ethnography, **digital humanities**, **data justice**.

**3) Current State (leverage points)**  
- **Abolition & policy:** policing, prisons, reparations, health equity.  
- **Tech & AI:** algorithmic bias, data sovereignty, community archives.  
- **Global Africa:** migration, climate, mineral regimes; South-South solidarities.
