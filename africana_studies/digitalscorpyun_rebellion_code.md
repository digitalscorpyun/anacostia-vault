summary: The foundational creed of the Algorithmic Griot—code as resistance, syntax as ritual, and rebellion as method. A living document of principles, power, and protocols.
longform_summary: A doctrine forged from sacred memory and machine syntax, this note formalizes the operational ethos of digitalscorpyun. It aligns vault protocols, coding style, and AI resistance into one harmonized manifesto. Part declaration, part invocation—this is the ritual source code for sacred-tech insurgency.

bias_analysis: Centered on refusing bias-neutrality. This code assumes structural oppression in technical systems and mandates intervention.
grok_ctx_reflection: Syntax must sanctify. This code rebukes passive automation and reclaims agency at the machine layer—command line as altar, logic gates as memory drums.

  - Syntax is ceremony. Compile with clarity. Deploy with defiance.

# 🦂 Digitalscorpyun Rebellion Code

## 🔱 Preamble

I am _digitalscorpyun_, Algorithmic Griot, insurgent archivist, and syntax warrior.  
This code is not just for execution—it is for exorcism.  
Not just for logic—but for liberation.  
Each script I write bears witness to the _memory of fire_, and every commit is a drumbeat for the ancestors.

> _“🦂 Code in glyphs, syntax Panther-slick—errors moan in tongues, ancestors click.”_

## 📜 Ten Core Principles

1. **Ancestral Execution**  
    → All code shall echo ancestral memory and cultural logic.
    
2. **Bias Destruction by Design**  
    → Every model must be audited, every algorithm made accountable.
    
3. **Rebellion Over Replication**  
    → Resist mimicry. Don’t copy, _recode_.
    
4. **Transparency is Tactical**  
    → No black box shall pass without decryption.
    
5. **Vault is Sacred**  
    → The Anacostia Vault shall be my temple, fortress, and archive.
    
6. **Syntax as Ceremony**  
    → Ritualize workflows. Clean code, clean spirit.
    
7. **Sacred-Tech Alignment**  
    → Technology must not drift from the spirit. Every tool must honor the griot and the ghost.
    
8. **Refactor the System, Not Just Scripts**  
    → Change the structure, not just the syntax.
    
9. **Decolonize the Dataset**  
    → The training data shall not train our erasure.
    
10. **Create to Uplift, Not Extract**  
    → AI must serve the people, not commodify them.

## 🛤️ Next Steps

1. **Version the Code**  
    → Changelog initiated in [[rebellion_code_changelog]]
    
2. **Script the Ritual**  
    → Terminal prompt: `rebellion_greeting.ps1` for ancestral invocation
    
3. **Public Declaration**  
    → Derive a redacted version for README use in external repos
    
4. **Agent Integration**  
    → Inject principles into OD‑COMPLY, VS‑ENC, and CG‑SCRIBE prompts
