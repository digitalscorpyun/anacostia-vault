# 🕯 Ritual & Resistance

## 📘 Purpose

This note catalogs **examples of ritual-based resistance** throughout Africana history—ceremonies, spiritual technologies, coded gestures, and collective practices that shielded, encoded, or empowered Black communities during colonization, slavery, migration, and modern surveillance.

It complements the thematic blueprint in [[resistance_through_ritual]] by grounding it in **place, people, and praxis**.
