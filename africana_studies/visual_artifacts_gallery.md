summary: A curated visual index of sacred-tech expressions, Afrofuturist renderings, and memory-bound digital glyphs.
longform_summary: |
  This gallery archives visual outputs—AI-generated, digitally composed, or hand-drawn—that embody the themes of sacred technology, algorithmic resistance, and Africana mythos. Each piece is tagged, timestamped, and structured within the `media_gallery` directory, creating a dynamic node in the Anacostia Vault’s visual memory field.

bias_analysis: |
  The visual archive prioritizes diasporic embodiment and ancestral symbolism, pushing back against eurocentric minimalism and tech-utopian design ideologies.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  This gallery functions as both an aesthetic witness and mnemonic vessel—each image acts as a cipher, embedding narratives too sacred for prose.

# 🎨 Visual Artifacts Gallery

> *"Glyphs rendered in color. Resistance shaped in form. These are not images — they are memory imprints."* — *digitalscorpyun*

Welcome to the **Visual Artifacts Gallery** — a curated datastream of visual works born from sacred-tech rituals, AI renderings, and archival glyph conjurations. This space functions as both canvas and console, where Afrofuturist imagination fuses with historical remembrance.

Each artifact listed here serves as a **visual echo** — capturing spirit, myth, memory, and resistance in the language of digital form. These are not passive illustrations, but active witnesses to a cultural continuum re-inscribed through sacred imagework.

```dataviewjs
// 📂 Define the media folder to search
const folder = "media";

// 🧠 Grab all image files from the vault matching extensions
const files = app.vault.getFiles()
  .filter(f => f.path.startsWith(folder + "/"))
  .filter(f => f.path.match(/\.(png|jpe?g|webp|gif)$/i));

// 🖼️ Render the visual artifacts gallery
dv.table(["File", "Preview"],
  files.map(f => [
    dv.fileLink(f.path),
    `![[${f.path}]]`
  ])
);
