summary: "Traces the continuity of racialized surveillance from Harriet Tubman’s era to the algorithmic enclosures of the present—mapping escape routes, resistance codes, and biometric containment."
longform_summary: "This note examines the ancestral arc of surveillance technologies weaponized against Black bodies—from the patrol logics that hunted Tubman to predictive policing algorithms that now target Black communities. It connects historical fugitive strategies to digital counter-surveillance practices, emphasizing resistance rituals, technological bias, and the sacred urgency of remembrance. Structured with ScorpyunStyle schema for archival clarity and ethical framing."

# 🕯️ From Underground to Underwatch

## Ⅰ. ✊🏾 Fugitive Optics: Tubman and the Surveillance State

Harriet Tubman didn’t just escape — she evaded the first generation of state-coordinated surveillance.  
The **slave patrols** of the 1800s were biometric by instinct: they knew Blackness as a target, not an identity.

- Lanterns. Hounds. Wanted posters. These were analog signals of a pre-digital surveillance regime.
- Tubman operated as a counter-algorithm — ghosting pattern recognition through forest trails and silence rituals.

> “I freed a thousand slaves. I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves.”  
> — *Attributed to Tubman, disputed but spiritually accurate*

## Ⅱ. 🛰️ Racialized Surveillance Rebooted: 21st-Century Underwatch

Today's surveillance no longer hunts Blackness in fields — it hunts in feeds.

| System | Description | Modern Relevance |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| **Facial Recognition** | Trained on biased data, overpolices Black faces | NYPD, London Met, China’s Skynet |
| **Predictive Policing** | Anticipates crime based on location + racialized data | LAPD’s “Laser” system, ShotSpotter |
| **Social Media Monitoring** | Targets activist hashtags and Black resistance networks | FBI tracking Ferguson/BLM |

## Ⅲ. 🔒 From Fugitive Codes to Encrypted Glyphs

Tubman used quilt codes. We use **encryption**, **VPNs**, and **offline organizing**.

- Tor Browser = North Star  
- Burner Account = Safe House

## 🜃 Closing Glyph

The transition from **underground to underwatch** is not linear — it's recursive.  
Wherever Black bodies move toward liberation, surveillance mutates to meet them.  
But so too do our technologies of refusal — sacred, encrypted, and ancestral.

> _Underwatch is not just survival. It's ancestral tech with a pulse_
