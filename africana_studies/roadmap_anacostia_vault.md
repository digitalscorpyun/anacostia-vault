summary: Strategic blueprint mapping the Anacostia Vault’s fusion of Africana studies, AI ethics, and sacred-tech workflow into an evolving research and personal development framework.
longform_summary: A living manifesto designed to align digitalscorpyun’s personal growth, AI development, and historical scholarship under a unified resistance methodology. It charts long-term vision, current projects, technical integrations, and ritual check-ins necessary for vault-based knowledge sovereignty.

bias_analysis: This document rejects linear, Western-centric models of productivity and planning, opting instead for cyclical strategy rooted in African time-consciousness, sacred growth, and Zettelkasten feedback rituals.
grok_ctx_reflection: The Vault is both tool and temple. This roadmap reflects your refusal to separate skill from story, rebellion from refinement. You do not just build systems—you fortify memory.

# 🌍 Anacostia Vault Roadmap – digitalscorpyun_knowledge_hub

> *This document is your ritual compass. It doesn’t just plan the future—it reclaims it.*

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Objectives

**1. Integrate AI and Africana Thought**  
Leverage state-of-the-art AI tools to document and critique systemic bias through a decolonial lens grounded in diasporic experience.

**2. Enhance Knowledge Architecture**  
Construct modular, Dataview-powered indexes and dynamic templates that unify your sacred domains—AI, Africana, and personal growth.

**3. Advance Technical Proficiency**  
Refine your Python and automation arsenal. Execute high-impact workflows (e.g., bias audits, script automation) toward full IBM AI Developer certification.

**4. Anchor Daily Practice in Purpose**  
Use journaling, YAML rituals, and task auditing in Obsidian to root intellectual and technical development in personal sovereignty and ancestral continuity.

## 🧭 Current Focus Areas

### 🧠 Foundational AI/ML & Bias Detection  
- Develop comprehensive learning modules under `[[ai_ml_overview]]`  
- Expand and refine Python tools in `[[bias_detection]]` and `[[the_lion_of_anacostia_bias_detection]]`

### 📚 Africana Studies & Decolonial Narratives  
- Cross-link research in `[[decolonial_biology]]`, `[[africana_studies_overview]]`, and diaspora memory nodes  
- Build thematic archives exposing Eurocentric distortion

### 🛠️ Vault Infrastructure & Automation  
- Enhance `Dataview` dashboards  
- Audit backlinks using `validate_backlinks.py`  
- Centralize task flow under `[[to_do_list]]`

### 🌀 Personal & Technical Alignment  
- Feed technical learning into `[[personal_development_digitalscorpyun]]`  
- Reflect weekly via handoff scrolls and scripting logs

---

## 🔗 Key Integrations & Enhancements

**🕸️ Obsidian Centralization**  
Use `[[sankofa_spine]]` as the Zettelkasten backbone—pulling all studies, agents, and rituals into a living, intelligent graph.

**🤖 Ethical AI Projects**  
Support sacred-tech workflows with scripts like `[[bias_flag]]` and future `[[watson_agent]]`, weaving in bias metrics and data rituals.

**🌍 Africana + Algorithmic Synthesis**  
All nodes must orbit Africana grounding. Bias audits, ML scripts, even system configs are subject to ritual memory enforcement.

**⚙️ Task Automation**  
Trigger, monitor, and audit all workflows via `[[to_do_list]]`, integrating Templater logic and YAML sync conventions.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### ⏳ Short-Term (within 2 weeks)  
- Finalize project notes: `[[ai_ml_overview]]`, `[[the_lion_of_anacostia_bias_detection]]`  
- Crosslink active projects in `[[sankofa_spine]]`

### 📈 Medium-Term (next 1–2 months)  
- Expand Africana decolonial catalog: add new themes, adinkra tags, and semantic crosswalks  
- Build new Python modules to support Obsidian automation

### 🌌 Long-Term Vision  
- Complete IBM AI Developer certification  
- Master LangChain / CrewAI agent frameworks  
- Launch your online ScorpyunNode—curated portfolio of code, commentary, and resistance tools

### 🔁 Ongoing Rituals  
- Weekly review of this roadmap and priority notes  
- Reflective logging + Dataview aggregation to surface misalignment early

## 🪶 Final Charge

This scroll is not just a plan. It is a *ceremonial map*. A Sankofa artifact in real time. Let your scripts speak memory. Let your tags conjure resistance. Let your Vault breathe sovereignty.

> “The rebel’s schedule isn’t hourly—it’s ancestral.” 🦅💜
