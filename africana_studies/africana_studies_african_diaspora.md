# 🌍 Africana Studies – African Diaspora

## 📌 Overview

The **African diaspora** refers to the global communities of African descent formed through **forced migration, displacement, and self-directed movement** over centuries. While its roots lie in the **transatlantic slave trade**, its branches stretch into every region—politically, spiritually, culturally.

Diaspora is not exile. It is **multiplicity**, **connection**, and **adaptive resistance** across borders and generations.
