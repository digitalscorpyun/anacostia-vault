summary: Ada Palmer reframes the Renaissance as a 19th-century colonial construct, exposing deliberate erasure of Islamic, African, and non-European knowledge traditions.
longform_summary: Palmer dismantles the myth of a European “Golden Age,” tracing how colonial Europe manufactured the Renaissance as its intellectual birthright while suppressing prior global contributions. The work resonates with AI’s present-day epistemic erasures, where “Western canon” dominates training data at the expense of Indigenous and Africana knowledge.

bias_analysis: Centering Palmer’s critique allows reframing Renaissance not as universal enlightenment but as colonial appropriation. Must guard against reproducing Eurocentric “myth-busting” without giving primacy to Africana voices.
grok_ctx_reflection: What Europe calls rebirth was theft and rebranding. The same pattern repeats in AI datasets today. Question what’s missing, not just what’s claimed.
