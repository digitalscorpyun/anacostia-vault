# 👑 Queen Nzinga Mbande (1583–1663)

> _“I am not a guest in my own land. I rule here.”_

Queen Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba is **one of the fiercest anti-colonial strategists in global history**. Born in 1583 into the royal Mbundu lineage of present-day Angola, Nzinga emerged as a ruler, warrior, and diplomat who bent colonial ambitions into knots—and held her kingdom intact for decades.

She didn’t just fight—**she governed, negotiated, deceived, and triumphed** in a world designed to erase her.

## 🏴 Matriarch of Revolution

Nzinga redefined leadership, not by mimicking Europe—but by **outwitting it**. She played Catholic when necessary, signed treaties as tactical delays, and often violated them with precision. Her statehood was not reactive—it was **ritualized sovereignty**.
