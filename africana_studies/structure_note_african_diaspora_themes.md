# 🌍 African Diaspora – Core Themes

## 🔑 Overview

The African diaspora is more than displacement—it is continuity through rupture, memory through fracture, and transformation in exile. This structure note gathers thematic currents that course through your vault—threads of liberation, spirituality, identity, resistance, and renewal.

---

## 🧠 Primary Themes

### 1. **Resistance & Rebellion**
- Enslaved revolts: Haiti, Palmares, 1811 German Coast  
- Black Power & liberation theology  
- Vault link: [[black_liberation_movement]]

### 2. **Spiritual Technology**
- Syncretism: Vodou, Ifá, Gullah spirituality  
- Adinkra, Nsibidi, Kemet tech-symbolism  
- Vault link: [[sacred_tech_lens]], [[digitalscorpyun_rebellion_code]]

### 3. **Memory & Historical Consciousness**
- Sankofa as active method  
- Generational trauma → narrative agency  
- Projects: oral histories, digital griot archiving  
- Vault link: [[sankofa_spine]]

### 4. **Displacement & Belonging**
- Middle Passage metaphors  
- Double-consciousness, fractured home  
- Afro-descendant movements in South America, Caribbean, Europe

### 5. **Creativity as Survival**
- Jazz, hip-hop, Afrofuturism as mnemonic technologies  
- Black speculative fiction as political resistance  
- Vault link: [[afrofuturism_overview]]

## 💡 Cross-Disciplinary Integration

| Domain        | Integration Idea |
|---------------|------------------|
| AI/ML Ethics  | Encode diaspora memory frameworks into audit logic (bias flag + historical context) |
| Python Dev    | Build `diaspora_graph.py` → visual network of migration, movement, memory |
| Design        | UI motifs from Kente, Sankofa, Adinkra — render thematic presence |
| Storytelling  | Develop prompt sets for `digitalscorpyun` that pull from diaspora mythologies |

---

## 🛤️ Next Steps

1. Create [[diasporic_literature_index]] to map texts like *Discourse on Colonialism*, *The Black Jacobins*, *Kindred*  
2. Begin `ritual_and_resistance.md` note to gather sacred-tech survival traditions  
3. Embed a Dataview index of all tagged `#african_diaspora` notes  
4. Propose a `diaspora_visualizer.py` project for plotting themes across timelines and geographies
