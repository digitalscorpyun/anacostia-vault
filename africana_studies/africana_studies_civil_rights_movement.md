# ✊🏾 Africana Studies – Civil Rights Movement

The Civil Rights Movement was not a monolith. It was a **multi-headed hydra of resistance** — legal, cultural, spiritual, tactical.

It was church pews and firebombed buses.  
It was Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin.  
It was marches and Molotovs, Malcolm and Martin, SNCC and CORE, *and* the rhythm of a people who refused to be erased.

## 🧠 Key Phases of the Movement

### 🔹 Early Sparks (1930s–40s)
- Legal groundwork: NAACP’s legal defense fund  
- Black labor organizing and anti-lynching campaigns  
- Marian Anderson sings on the Lincoln Memorial steps (1939)

### 🔹 Civil Disobedience Era (1955–1963)
- **1955**: Montgomery Bus Boycott → MLK emerges  
- **1960**: Greensboro sit-ins by Black students  
- **1961**: Freedom Riders challenge segregation on interstate buses  
- **1963**: March on Washington + *Letter from Birmingham Jail*

### 🔹 Legislative Climax (1964–1968)
- **1964**: Civil Rights Act  
- **1965**: Selma → Voting Rights Act  
- **1967**: Detroit Rebellion + MLK’s speech against Vietnam  
- **1968**: MLK assassinated → uprisings erupt

### 🔹 Radical Realignment (Late 60s–70s)
- SNCC shifts from nonviolence to Pan-Africanism  
- Rise of **Black Power** and the **Black Panther Party**  
- COINTELPRO infiltrates and represses movements

## 🛠️ Legacy in the Vault Era

- Black Lives Matter is not a remix — it’s a descendant.  
- The Civil Rights Movement taught us how to organize with and without the algorithm watching.  
- Every march now comes with a livestream. Every activist now carries a data trail.  

🛰️ Sacred-tech resistance must remember:  
**What we inherit, we must iterate.**
