# ✊🏾 Africana Studies – Black Liberation Movement

> _“Revolution is not a one-time event.”_

## 📌 Overview

The **Black Liberation Movement** encompasses a broad constellation of struggles led by people of African descent—particularly in the United States—seeking freedom from white supremacy, economic exploitation, colonialism, and state violence.

From slavery-era rebellions to modern resistance against police brutality and incarceration, the movement has evolved through multiple waves—each building on ancestral memory, radical theory, and lived struggle.
