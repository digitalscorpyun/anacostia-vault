# üèõ Little House √ó Afrikaner Mythmap (UBW)

A UBW lineage note mapping **U.S. frontier TV myth** (*Little House on the Prairie*) to **Afrikaner settler myth** (Great Trek ‚Üí **Transvaal/OFS**), with receipts and leverage points.

---

## Origins

- **U.S. (Upper Midwest, 1860s‚Äì80s):**  
  Homestead Act (1862) + railroad capital create a legal pipeline to seize **Dakota** and **Anishinaabe** land. The Ingalls narratives recode occupation as family innocence.

  **Receipts:** Homestead Act ¬ß1‚Äì¬ß6; U.S.‚ÄìDakota War of **1862**; subsequent treaty abrogations.

- **South Africa (Highveld, 1830s‚Äì1902):**  
  **Great Trek** sacralizes the laager and volk; Boer republics‚Äî**ZAR/Transvaal** and **OFS**‚Äîemerge amid wars with African polities (Zulu, Sotho, Tswana). ‚ÄúEmpty veld‚Äù becomes the alibi.

  **Receipts:** Sand River Convention (**1852**), Bloemfontein Convention (**1854**), Anglo‚ÄìBoer conflicts leading to Union (**1910**).

---

## Modifications / Moments

- **U.S.:** Reservation policy, boarding schools; later a **1970s TV** retelling that centers pioneer virtue and moves state violence offscreen.

- **SA:** Frontier **commando** system, pass laws; **Anglo‚ÄìBoer Wars** and later **apartheid** formalize exclusions romanticized in Boer lore.

**Receipts tips:** Close each bullet with 1‚Äì2 anchors (dates/cases/clauses) in your field drafts.

---

## Current State (Echoes & Levers)

**Narrative tropes:** ‚ÄúEmpty land,‚Äù family sovereignty, wagon/ox-wagon icon, virtue-through-hardship.  
**Leverage:** Name the erased polities in overlays and captions; pair episodes/chapters with **treaties, conventions, expulsions**, and land-claim maps.

- **U.S. levers:** Mark **Dakota & Anishinaabe** jurisdiction; append Homestead claim IDs where known.  
- **SA levers:** Name **Khoikhoi/San/Zulu/Sotho/Tswana** sovereignties alongside **ZAR/OFS** timelines.

## Bluesky-ready drops (‚â§300 chars)

1) **Thesis**  
*Little House* wasn‚Äôt just comfort TV‚Äîit‚Äôs **settler curriculum**. A family on **Dakota land** framed as innocence. Swap hemispheres: Great Trek ‚Üí **Transvaal/OFS** carved from ‚Äúempty‚Äù veld. Same myth, new accent. #SettlerMyth #Transvaal

2) **Mechanics**  
Call land **empty**, call conquest **pioneer grit**, move violence **offscreen**, crown the family as **sovereignty**. Covered wagon ‚Üî ox-wagon. #MediaLiteracy #SettlerColonialism

3) **Receipts hook**  
Map it: **Homestead Act & 1862 Dakota war** ‚Üí Ingalls myth; **Sand River & Bloemfontein** ‚Üí Boer republics. Treaties bless theft; TV & volk legends bless memory. #HistoryNotHallmark

## Workbench / To-Do

- [ ] Drop pin overlays for Dakota treaties alongside *Little House* episode guide.  
- [ ] Match ZAR/OFS milestones to laager imagery in school texts.  
- [ ] Add citations list for classroom pack (primary laws + 3 scholarly overviews).
