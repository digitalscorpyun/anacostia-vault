# Africana Freedom Philosophies

## Definition (working)
Freedom as **collective practice** rather than status: forged through flight, covenant, abolitionist care, and counter-memory. Opposes enslaving and colonial logics across the Black Atlantic.

## Lineages / Threads
- **Fugitivity & Maroonage:** clandestine movement, place-making, sovereignty-in-the-making.  
- **Abolitionist Ethics:** dismantle cage/logistics systems; build care infrastructures.  
- **Pan-African & Anti-Colonial Thought:** self-determination, federation, reparations.  
- **Black Feminist Economies of Care:** household labor, mutual aid, church societies.  
- **Counter-Archive & Testimony:** enslaved narratives, rememory, folk law.

## Vocabulary
- *Covenant over contract* — people made by promise/care, not market/legal status.  
- *Undercommons* — study/practice outside managerial capture.  
- *Rememory* — return that re-makes.

## Applied to **Keckley** (reading thread)
- **Memoir-as-witness:** truth claim via craft labor + proximity to power.  
- **Care economy:** Contraband Relief Association as abolitionist infrastructure.  
- **Temporal weave:** past-present simultaneity; memory as terrain.  
- **Gendered sovereignty:** dressmaking as capital, mobility, and speech.

## Tensions & Contradictions
- Recognition vs. refusal | Respectability vs. fugitivity  
- National citizenship vs. diasporic belonging  
- Archive of the state vs. counter-archive of lived testimony
