longform_summary: |
  Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley (1818–1907) transformed expert needlework into economic
  power, community care, and authorship. Enslaved in Virginia and Missouri, she
  purchased freedom for herself and her son, built a Washington, D.C. dressmaking
  house serving political elites, became Mary Todd Lincoln’s modiste and confidante,
  and published a landmark memoir that reclaims Black women’s labor, memory, and voice.

bias_analysis: |
  Read against benevolent-slavery mythologies; foreground Keckley’s agency in labor,
  finance, and authorship rather than reducing her to proximity with the Lincolns.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Craft became currency; memory became testimony. Keckley stitched freedom into a public life.
quotes:
  - "Needlework as strategy; authorship as aftercare."
  - "A life re-stitched from labor, kin-love, and witness."
