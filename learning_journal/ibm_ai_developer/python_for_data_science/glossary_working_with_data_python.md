# 📘 Glossary: Working with Data in Python

Welcome! This alphabetized glossary contains core terms from Module 4 of the IBM AI Developer program, along with widely-used industry concepts in file I/O, Pandas, and NumPy.

---

## 🔤 Terms and Definitions

- **.csv file** – Plain text file format for tabular data, where commas separate columns.
- **.txt file** – Plain text format for storing raw, unformatted textual data.
- **Append** – To add data to the end of a file or list without overwriting existing content.
- **Attribute** – A property or characteristic of a Python object, accessed using dot notation.
- **Broadcasting (NumPy)** – A method allowing operations on arrays of different shapes by extending dimensions.
- **Component** – A specific indexed value in a NumPy array.
- **Computation** – Execution of numerical operations, often using vectorized NumPy functions.
- **Data analysis** – The process of cleaning, interpreting, and visualizing data to extract insights.
- **DataFrame** – A two-dimensional, table-like structure in Pandas with labeled axes.
- **Dependencies (Pandas)** – Required external modules such as NumPy that power Pandas functions.
- **File attribute** – Metadata about a file, often handled at the OS level.
- **File object** – Python object created by `open()` to interact with a file’s contents.
- **Grid** – A 2D structure of rows and columns; used in arrays and plotting.
- **Hadamard Product** – Element-wise multiplication of two identically shaped matrices.
- **Importing Pandas** – `import pandas as pd`; standard convention for loading the library.
- **Index** – An integer or label used to access data at a specific position.
- **Libraries** – Bundled code collections offering reusable functionality (e.g., NumPy, Pandas).
- **Linspace** – NumPy function generating evenly spaced values across a range.
- **NumPy** – Foundational numerical computing library for Python arrays and math.
- **One-dimensional NumPy** – A linear array, like a Python list but optimized for math.
- **Open function** – Built-in function to open a file in read, write, or append mode.
- **Pandas** – A high-level data analysis library built on top of NumPy.
- **Pandas library** – Full set of tools and modules for data wrangling and transformation.
- **Plotting Mathematical Functions** – Using tools like Matplotlib to visually express equations or array transformations.
- **Shape (NumPy)** – Tuple showing number of rows and columns in an array.
- **Slicing (NumPy)** – Extracting parts of an array using ranges or steps.
- **Two-dimensional NumPy** – A matrix-like array with rows and columns.
- **Universal Functions (ufuncs)** – Fast, element-wise NumPy operations such as `np.sin()`, `np.dot()`, etc.
- **Vector addition** – Summing the corresponding elements of two vectors.
- **Visualizations** – Graphical representations of data for analysis, using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Keep this glossary close as you traverse data paths. The syntax is only the beginning. These terms are your keys.

🧠💽 ScorpyunNote: "Shape tells size. Append holds memory. Index cuts like ritual. NumPy is discipline — not convenience."
