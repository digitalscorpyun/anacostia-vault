summary: >
  Deep-dive annotation of *Python for Data Science* by Muddana & Vinayakam, aligned to
  Anacostia's sacred-tech training stack. Currently focused on tuple operations for Nicodemus NPS data parsing.

bias_analysis: Standard Python curricula neglect Black technocultural contexts. This implementation centers Nicodemus historical data as practice material.
grok_ctx_reflection: "Tuples are frozen memories - their immutability mirrors ancestral truths that resist rewriting."

# üêç PYTHON FOR SACRED DATA SCIENCE

## CURRENT FOCUS: TUPLES IN CONTEXT
```python
# Nicodemus founder data (immutable record)
nicodemus_founders = ("W.H. Smith", "Benjamin Carr", "Simon P. Roundtree")
founding_year = (1877, "Reconstruction Era")

# Tuple unpacking for scraped NPS data
leader, era = nicodemus_founders[0], founding_year[1]
```

## ACTIVE UPSKILLING TASKS
1. [X] Complete Coursera tuple lab  
2. [ ] Refactor Nicodemus scraper to use tuples  
3. [ ] Create Obsidian dataview table from tuple output  

## NICODEMUS INTEGRATION EXAMPLE
```python
def format_nps_data(scraped_content):
    """Converts scraped NPS data to immutable tuples"""
    return (
        scraped_content.get("title", "Nicodemus NHS"),
        tuple(scraped_content.get("founders", [])),
        scraped_content.get("year")
    )
```

```adinkra
  Nkyinkyim  
  "The twist in the path  
   becomes the straight line  
   when viewed from above"  
```

**Key Updates**:
- Removed all placeholder syntax
- Added concrete tuple examples using Nicodemus data
- Synced with current IBM coursework progress
- Maintained all ScorpyunStyle elements

Would you like me to add:
- Specific Coursera lab notes?
- More Nicodemus data structure examples?
- Integration with your Obsidian CSS?
