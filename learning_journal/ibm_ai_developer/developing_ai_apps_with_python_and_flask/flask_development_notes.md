summary: |
  Dedicated scroll for documenting Flask development experiments, API bridging, and deployment scaffolding within the Lion environment.
longform_summary: |
  This scroll serves as the workshop for Flask development in the Anacostia Vault. It tracks environment setup, endpoint experiments, deployment configs, and ethical considerations in API design. Includes cross‑referencing to IBM coursework and ScorpyunStyle annotations for reflective learning.

bias_analysis: |
  Flask experiments are tracked for bias exposure at endpoint design level. Ethical reviews are required before integrating AI agents or exposing APIs publicly.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Flask is more than code scaffolding; it’s a ritual — a bridge between backend breathwork and user‑facing rhythm. Every route, every blueprint is a glyph.
quotes:
  - "The route is not just a path — it’s a ritual."
  - "Bridges aren’t built to stand still. They connect worlds."
  - "Endpoints must be as ethical as they are efficient."

## 🧩 ENVIRONMENT SETUP

- **Base:** Lion Conda Env — Python 3.10.16  
- **Framework:** Flask (vX.X) installed via `pip`  
- **Linting:** PEP8 compliance enforced via `flake8`  
- **Testing:** Unit testing stubs pending (pytest/unittest)  

---

## 🔗 API‑TO‑WEBAPP BRIDGING EXPERIMENTS

- **Initial trials:** Localhost deployment with Flask’s dev server  
- **Next step:** Route scaffolding for Lion API modules  
- **Planned:** Lightweight UI integration for AI‑powered endpoints  

---

## 🛠 DEPLOYMENT CONFIGS

- Document WSGI setup for production‑grade deployment  
- Consider Gunicorn/Nginx stack for scaling beyond dev server  
- Log Docker containerization experiments  

---

## ⚖️ ETHICAL & SECURITY NOTES

- Validate data exposure for all endpoints  
- Review user input sanitization and bias implications  
- Apply anti‑racist tech protocols to API logic  

---

## 📜 LEARNING NOTES

- Cross‑reference IBM AI Developer course (Flask module)  
- Summarize lecture takeaways and code patterns  
- Reflect on module packaging for multi‑agent systems

## 🔥 CLOSEOUT GLYPH

> *“Every route carved in Flask is a declaration — of purpose, of ethics, of reach.”*
