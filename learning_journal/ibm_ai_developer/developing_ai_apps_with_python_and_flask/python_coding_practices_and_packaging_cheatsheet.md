bias_analysis: |
  This cheatsheet prioritizes standard Python conventions (PEP8) and industry-accepted tools like Pylint and unittest. It intentionally centers on maintainability and readability over alternative rapid-prototyping styles.
grok_ctx_reflection: |
  Structure is ritual. From four spaces to CamelCase, every naming convention and test assertion is a glyph of discipline, ensuring code breathes, communicates, and scales. Even the smallest script can carry the weight of the sacred if styled and tested with care.
quotes:
  - "Readable code is maintained code."
  - "A package without structure is chaos in waiting."
  - "Tests aren‚Äôt chores‚Äîthey‚Äôre assurances."
