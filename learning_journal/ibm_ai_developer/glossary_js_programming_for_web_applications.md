summary: Glossary of key JavaScript programming terms relevant to building interactive web applications, drawn from IBM's AI Developer coursework.
longform_summary: This scroll collects essential terms and core definitions relevant to JavaScript programming for dynamic, client-side web applications. It serves as a quick-reference lexicon for concepts like DOM manipulation, asynchronous operations, object inheritance, and event handlingâ€”aligned with sacred-tech study practices in the Anacostia Vault.

# ðŸ“š JavaScript Programming Glossary (Web Applications)

> This glossary supports the spiritual practice of front-end fluency. Each term is a glyph in the script of the browser temple.

## ðŸ§  TERMS & DEFINITIONS

| **Term** | **Definition** |
|---------|----------------|
| **AJAX** | Asynchronous JavaScript and XML â€” a conceptual approach for dynamically updating web pages. Commonly uses JSON now. |
| **Anonymous Functions** | Functions without a name, often passed as arguments or invoked immediately. |
| **Array** | A zero-indexed data structure to store ordered collections of values. |
| **Classes** | Templates for objects, containing properties and methods. |
| **Client-Side Script** | Code that runs in the browser (HTML `<script>` tag), enabling dynamic interactions. |
| **Document Objects** | Refers to `document` â€” the HTML DOM interface. |
| **DOM (Document Object Model)** | The browser's API for HTML â€” enables scripts to read/write elements and structure. |
| **Element Nodes** | HTML tags in the DOM tree. |
| **Element Objects** | The most basic DOM objects representing HTML elements. |
| **Event** | User or browser-triggered interaction (e.g., click, input). |
| **Event Binding** | Connecting a function to an event trigger. |
| **Event Handlers** | Functions that respond to events (e.g., `onclick="doThis()"`). |
| **Extend** | Inheritance keyword used in class hierarchies. |
| **Functions** | Modular code blocks performing specific tasks. |
| **IIFE** | Immediately Invoked Function Expression â€” runs once upon definition. |
| **Nodes** | Structural units in the DOM. Can be elements or text. |
| **Objects** | Instances of classes. Contain state and behavior. |
| **Prototypes** | Templates from which object properties and methods are inherited. |
| **Script** | JavaScript code that enhances interactivity and document manipulation. |
| **Self-Executing Functions** | Functions that run immediately; often used for setup/init logic. |
| **Text Nodes** | Contain text between tags. |
| **this** | Refers to the current context or object instance. |

Would you like me to append JS visual examples or interactive DOM tree diagrams next?
